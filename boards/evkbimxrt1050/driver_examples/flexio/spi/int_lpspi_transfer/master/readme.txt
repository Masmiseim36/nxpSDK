Overview
========
The flexio_spi_master_interrupt_lpspi_slave example shows how to use flexio spi master driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated master connect to a lpspi slave .


Running the demo
================
You can see the similar message shows following in the terminal if the example runs successfully.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLEXIO Master - LPSPI Slave interrupt example start.

This example use one flexio spi as master and one lpspi instance as slave on one board.

Master and slave are both use interrupt way.

Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:

FLEXIO_SPI_master -- LPSPI_slave

      CLK        --    CLK

      PCS        --    PCS

      SOUT       --    SIN

      SIN        --    SOUT

This is LPSPI slave call back.

FLEXIO SPI master <-> LPSPI slave transfer all data matched!

End of example.

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVKB-IMXRT1050 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Remove the resistor R334 and weld 0Ω resistor to R278,R279,R280,R281.

To make the example work, connections needed to be as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        SLAVE           connect to      MASTER
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       J24-4                SIN       SW5-3
SIN        J24-5                SOUT      SW5-2
SCK        J24-6                SCK       SW5-1
PCS0       J24-3                PCS0      SW5-4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.26
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1
- MCUXpresso 10.3.0
