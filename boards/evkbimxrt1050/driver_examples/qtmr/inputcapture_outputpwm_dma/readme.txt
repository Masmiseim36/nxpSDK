Overview
========

The QTMR project is a demonstration program of the SDK QTMR driver's input capture and output pwm feature by DMA.
The example sets up a QTMR channel for input capture. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print the capture value.
The example also sets up one QTMR channel to output pwm. The user should probe a 50Khz PWM signal output with
50% dutycycle with a oscilloscope.The user can enter a value to update the Duty cycle.
Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVKB-IMXRT1050 board
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
- Connect input signal to J23-6.
- Use oscilloscope to measure output the signal pin at J23-5.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
****Input capture dma example start.****

****Provide a signal input to the QTMR pin****

Captured Period time = 998 us (Â±5%)

****Output PWM dma example.****

*********Make sure to connect an oscilloscope.*********

****A 50 duty cycle PWM wave is observed on an oscilloscope.****

Please enter a value to update the Duty cycle:
Note: The range of value is 1 to 9.
For example: If enter '5', the duty cycle will be set to 50 percent.
Value:3
The duty cycle was successfully updated!

Please enter a value to update the Duty cycle:
