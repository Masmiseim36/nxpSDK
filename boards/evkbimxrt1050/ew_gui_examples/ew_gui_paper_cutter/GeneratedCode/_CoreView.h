/* The class Core::View provides the base functionality for all visual components. 
   This class implements a set of methods and properties to manage the view, to 
   redraw its content, to receive and handle any user input events and to arrange 
   it on the screen. 
   The class Core::View doesn't define any particular behavior nor appearance. It 
   exists as an empty base for all derived view classes like the Views::Text or 
   Views::Image.
   Views never appear alone. Within a GUI application they are composed to complex 
   GUI components, like the push button or the slider. This composition is done 
   by the class Core::Group. In this manner each view belongs to a superior group 
   and can be managed by this group. For example, showing the group makes visible

/* The method Draw() is invoked automatically if parts of the view should be redrawn 
   on the screen. This can occur when e.g. the view has been moved or the appearance 
   of the view has changed before.
   Draw() is invoked automatically by the framework, you never will need to invoke 
   this method directly. However you can request an invocation of this method by 
   calling the method InvalidateArea() of the views @Owner. Usually this is also 
   unnecessary unless you are developing your own view.
   The passed parameters determine the drawing destination aCanvas and the area 
   to redraw aClip in the coordinate space of the canvas. The parameter aOffset 
   contains the displacement between the origin of the views owner and the origin 
   of the canvas. You will need it to convert views coordinates into these of the 
   canvas.
   The parameter aOpacity contains the opacity descended from this view's @Owner. 
   It lies in range 0 .. 255. If the view implements its own 'Opacity', 'Color', 
   etc. properties, the Draw() method should calculate the resulting real opacity 
   by mixing the values of these properties with the one passed in aOpacity parameter.
   The parameter aBlend contains the blending mode descended from this view's @Owner. 
   It determines, whether the view should be drawn with alpha-blending active or 
   not. If aBlend is false, the outputs of the view should overwrite the corresponding 
   pixel in the drawing destination aCanvas. If aBlend is true, the outputs should 
   be mixed with the pixel already stored in aCanvas. For this purpose all Graphics 
   Engine functions provide a parameter to specify the mode for the respective drawing 
   operation. If the view implements its own 'Blend' property, the Draw() method 
   should calculate the resulting real blend mode by using logical AND operation 
   of the value of the property and the one passed in aBlend parameter. */

/* The method HandleEvent() is invoked automatically if the view has received an 
   event. For example, touching the view on the touch screen can cause the view 
   to receive a Core::CursorEvent event. Within this method the view can evaluate 
   the event and react to it.
   Whether the event has been handled by the view or not is determined by the return 
   value. To sign an event as handled HandleEvent() should return a valid object 
   (e.g. 'this'). If the event has not been handled, 'null' should be returned.
   Depending on the kind of the event, the framework can continue dispatching of 
   still unhandled events. For example, keyboard events (Core::KeyEvent class) are 
   automatically delivered to the superior @Owner of the receiver view if this view 
   has ignored the event.
   HandleEvent() is invoked automatically by the framework, so you never should 
   need to invoke it directly. However you can prepare and post new events by using 
   the methods DispatchEvent() and BroadcastEvent() of the application class Core::Root. */

/* The method CursorHitTest() is invoked automatically in order to determine whether 
   the view is interested in the receipt of cursor events or not. This method will 
   be invoked immediately after the user has tapped the visible area of the view. 
   If the view is not interested in the cursor event, the framework repeats this 
   procedure for the next behind view until a willing view has been found or all 
   views are evaluated.
   In the implementation of the method the view can evaluate the passed aArea parameter. 
   It determines the place where the user has tapped the view with his fingertip 
   expressed in the coordinates of the views @Owner. The method can test e.g. whether 
   the tapped area does intersect any touchable areas within the view, etc. The 
   affected finger is identified in the parameter aFinger. The first finger (or 
   the first mouse device button) has the number 0.
   The parameter aStrikeCount determines how many times the same area has been tapped 
   in series. This is useful to detect series of multiple touches, e.g. in case 
   of the double click, aStrikeCount == 2.
   The parameter aDedicatedView, if it is not 'null', restricts the event to be 
   handled by this view only. If aDedicatedView == null, no special restriction 
   exists.
   This method is also invoked if during an existing grab cycle the current target 
   view has decided to resign and deflect the cursor events to another view. This 
   is usually the case after the user has performed a gesture the current target 
   view is not interested to process. Thereupon, the system looks for another view 
   willing to take over the cursor event processing after the performed gesture. 
   Which gesture has caused the operation, is specified in the parameter aRetargetReason.
   If the view is willing to process the event, the method should create, initialize 
   and return a new Core::CursorHit object. This object identify the willing view. 
   Otherwise the method should return 'null'.
   CursorHitTest() is invoked automatically by the framework, so you never should 
   need to invoke it directly. This method is predetermined for the hit-test only. 
   The proper processing of events should take place in the @HandleEvent() method 
   by reacting to Core::CursorEvent and Core::DragEvent events. */

/* The method ArrangeView() is invoked automatically if the superior @Owner group 
   needs to re-arrange its views. For example, the changing of the owners size can 
   cause the enclosed views to adapt their position and size, so all views still 
   fit within the new owners area. This method provides the core functionality for 
   the automatic GUI layout mechanism.
   The arrangement is controlled primarily by the @Layout property of the view. 
   It specifies a set of alignment constraints and determines whether the view can 
   change its size. The bounds area where the view should be arranged, is passed 
   in the parameter aBounds. This is usually the current area of the views owner.
   The parameter aFormation defines the desired arrangement mode. Depending on the 
   value of this parameter, the views can be arranged in rows or columns. If aFormation 
   == Core::Formation.None, no automatic row/column arrangement is performed and 
   the view is moved and scaled only to fit inside the aBounds area.

   need to invoke it directly.

   the corners are modified without performing any updates of the view and without 
   redrawing the screen. This is useful, when you wish to move or arrange a lot 
   of views at once. In this case it's up to you to request the finally screen update. 
   To do this you can use the method InvalidateArea() of the views @Owner.
   In the case aFastMove == false, the operation automatically requests the screen

   a screen redraw to make disappear the view from the screen.
