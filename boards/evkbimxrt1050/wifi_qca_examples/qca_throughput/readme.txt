Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Configure your dedicated device to create a WiFi network with
    SSID "nxp" and password "NXP0123456789"

    If you want to use notebook as an AP, please follow these instructions:
    a.  Download https://github.com/oblique/create_ap.git
    b.  Run "make install"
    c.  Connect ethernet cable with internet access to notebook.
    d.  Run command "sudo create_ap wlan0 eth0 nxp NXP0123456789"
    where 
        wlan0 - represent Linux Wifi device
        eth0  - represent Linux ethernet device
        nxp   - is a WiFi SSID
        NXP0123456789 - is a WiFi password

    The names of ethernet and WiFi device might be different.
    Find names in your system by running of command "ifconfig"

2.  Download and install FBENCH on your PC. FBENCH is available at:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/fbench/

3.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the SDA port
4.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.


Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the CMSIS DAP terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to run throughput test:

1) Connect your PC to "nxp" WiFi network. Let's assume that PC IP address in "nxp' network is 192.168.12.35 and GT202 will get IP 192.168.12.99.

2) Download demo to board and run following commands to connect GT202 to "nxp" WiFi.

    wmiconfig --p NXP0123456789
    wmiconfig --wpa 2 CCMP CCMP
    wmiconfig --connect nxp
    # obtain an IP by DHCP
    wmiconfig --ipdhcp

3) Run 'benchrx tcp 7007' command to receive TCP data on port 7007.
4) Launch FBENCH, switch to "IPV4 Receiving" tab.
   Set "local IP address" to 192.168.12.35 (or 0.0.0.0), "Local Port" to 7008 and press "Listen/Receive"
5) Run 'benchtx 192.168.12.35 7008 tcp 1024 0 600 0'
   Now the GT202 is transfering data to PC for 10 minutes, using packet size 1024B.
6) Launch new instance of FBENCH, switch to tab "IPV4 Sending".
   Set "Remote IP address" to IP 192.168.12.99 and "Remote Port" to 7007 and click to "Connect/Send".
   In this moment, the PC is transfering data to GT202.
7) Final test results are available in each FBENCH instance.

For more options, please type "help" or "wmiconfig --help".

Overview
========
The qca_throughput demo tests transfer throughput.


Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVKB-IMXRT1050 board
- GT202 Adaptor V1.04
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Plug GT202 Adaptor board to FRDM stackable headers (J1, J2, J3, J4).
Remove the resistor R334, dis-connect J15, and weld 0Î© resistor to R278,R279,R280,R281.

Known issues:
- IMX RT1050 is missing in FRDMGT202QSG_KSDK2.pdf
- A hardfault may occurs when running RX throughput benchmark.
- Output shell may be broken into two lines

Please use external power supply (J2), USB may not be sufficient.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.26
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1
- MCUXpresso 10.3.0
