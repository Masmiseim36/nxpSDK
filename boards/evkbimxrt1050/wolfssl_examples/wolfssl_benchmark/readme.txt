Overview
========
The wolfssl_benchmark demo application demonstrates cryptographic acceleration on supported platforms that have MMCAU,
LTC or similar accelerator peripheral. The hardware acceleration is enabled by default, and can be configured at build time in
the middleware/wolfssl/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h header file. FREESCALE_USE_MMCAU, FREESCALE_USE_LTC, FREESCALE_USE_LPC_AES
and FREESCALE_USE_LPC_SHA macros can be used to compile the wolfssl_benchmark project source code with support for
the Freescale hardware cryptographic accelerator, or when none of these macros is defined, all algorithms are implemented in software only.


Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVKB-IMXRT1050 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.
Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start TeraTerm
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start TeraTerm.

2. New connection -> Serial.

3. Set the appropriate COMx port (where x is port number) in the port context menu. The number is provided by the operation
   system, and could be different from computer to computer. Select the COM number related to virtual
   serial port. Confirm the selected port by clicking the "OK" button.

4. Set following connection parameters in menu Setup -> Serial port
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: none

5.  Confirm selected parameters by clicking the "OK" button.

Running the demo
================
The demo prints the system clock frequency and actual hardware acceleration configuration to the terminal,
then executes cryptographic algorithms. The results are printed to the terminal.
Actual result times may vary significantly depending on the device, its available hardware acceleration modules,
system clock frequency and the compiler used.
Below are example outputs produced on three different development boards.
