Overview
========
This "Image Detection" example shows the demonstration of using DeepViewRT API to do image detection
on an IMXRT platform. The application could identify multiple objects in a single image and outputs
the result via UART console. The result is including detected object name and bounding box array.

Library configuration
------------------------
 Stack memory configuration
 During the library compilation, based on the stack memory configuration,
 the EIGEN_STACK_ALLOCATION_LIMIT macro definition can be set to the maximum
 size of temporary objects that can be allocated on the stack
 (they will be dynamically allocated instead). A high number may cause stack
 overflow. A low number may decrease object allocation performance.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0
- Keil MDK  5.38.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1060-EVKB board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA(or USB to Serial) USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial(or USB to Serial) device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert the Ethernet Cable into the target board's RJ45 port and connect it to a router (or other DHCP server capable device).
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
