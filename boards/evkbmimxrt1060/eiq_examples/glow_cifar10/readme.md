Overview
========
Demonstrates inference for models compiled using the GLOW AOT tool.
The network used in this is based on the CIFAR-10 example in Caffe2 [1] & [2].

This project does not include the pre-trained model or the training script
since Caffe2 framework is deprecated and lately has become part of PyTorch.
This project example only includes the bundle (binary) generated after running
the Glow AOT tool and is intended to be used as-is. If you want a step-by-step
example of running the Glow AOT tool for a given model take a look at the
LeNet MNIST Glow example.

The neural network consists of 3 convolution layers interspersed by
ReLU activation and max pooling layers, followed by a fully-connected layer
at the end. The input to the network is a 32x32 pixel color image, which will 
be classified into one of the 10 output classes.
