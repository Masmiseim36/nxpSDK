This project is used to work with LittleVGL GUI Guider. The GUI Guider generated
code is placed in the folder "generated". The example generated code shows a
button in the panel.

===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.60.1
- Keil MDK  5.39.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1060-EVKB board
- Personal Computer
- RK043FN02H-CT or RK043FN66HS-CT6 LCD board

Board settings
==============
1. Connect the RK043FN02H-CT or RK043FN66HS-CT6 to board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Build the project, the project uses RK043FN66HS-CT6 by default, to use other panels,
    change
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK043FN66HS
    to
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK043FN02H
    in lvgl_support.h
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
If this example runs correctly, the sample GUI is displayed.

This board also supports LVGL 1-bit, 8-bit color depth, to use this feature, modify
LV_COLOR_DEPTH as 1 or 8 in lv_conf.h.

Currently GPU is not supported for 1-bit and 8-bit color depth, change LV_USE_GPU_NXP_PXP
to 0 in lv_conf.h.
