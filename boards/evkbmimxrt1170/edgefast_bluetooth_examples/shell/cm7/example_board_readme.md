The hardware should be reworked according to the Hardware Rework Guide for MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 1XK M.2 Adapter in document Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL.
The hardware should be reworked according to the Hardware Rework Guide for MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 1ZM M.2 Adapter in document Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL.
The hardware rework for MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 2EL M.2 Adapter is same as MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 1XK M.2 Adapter.

Note:
To ensure that the LITTLEFS flash region has been cleaned,
all flash sectors need to be erased before downloading example code.
After downloaded binary into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly,
please reset the board by pressing SW4 or power off and on the board to run the application.
