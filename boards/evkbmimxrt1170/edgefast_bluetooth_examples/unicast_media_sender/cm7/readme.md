Overview
========
Application demonstrating how to use the unicast media sender feature.

There should be three boards: 1 UMS + 1 UMR(left) + 1 UMR(right).
UMS: unicast stereo audio stream, left channel on first CIS and right channel on another CIS.
UMR: receive one of CIS channel and render it.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- Keil MDK  5.38.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- evkbmimxrt1170 board
- Personal Computer
- Embedded Artists 2EL M.2 Module (Rev-A1) - direct M2 connection.

Jumper settings for RT1170-EVKB (enables external 5V supply):
remove  J38 5-6
connect J38 1-2
connect J43 with external power(controlled by SW5)

Murata Solution Board settings
Embedded Artists 2EL module datasheet: https://www.embeddedartists.com/doc/ds/2EL_M2_Datasheet.pdf

The hardware should be reworked according to the Hardware Rework Guide for MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 1XK M.2 Adapter in document Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL.
The hardware rework for MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 2EL M.2 Adapter is same as MIMXRT1170-EVKB and Murata 1XK M.2 Adapter.

Note:
To ensure that the LITTLEFS flash region has been cleaned,
all flash sectors need to be erased before downloading example code.
After downloaded binary into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly,
please reset the board by pressing SW4 or power off and on the board to run the application.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Provide 5V voltage for the target board.

4.  Save a wav music file to a USB disk's root directory and named as "music_16_2.wav".

5.  Connect the USB disk to USB OTG1 port.

6.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

7.  Download the program to the target board.

8.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the example in the terminal window.

Procedures to run
1 input "help" to show command list.
2 make sure UMR left and right are initialized and start advertising.
3 the source will start to scan and connect to UMR automatically, then start playing after all UMR connected and configured.
4 input "pause" to stop playing.
5 input "play" to start playing.
6 input "vol_up", "vol_down", "vol_set" to set volume of all sinks.
7 input "vol_mute", "vol_unmute" to set mute of all sinks.

Note:
1 "exit" command is a shell internal command, only used to exit shell module and could not used to exit demo.
2 the "music_16_2.wav" should be 16/24/32bits 2 channel with sample rate 8000/16000/24000/32000/48000.
