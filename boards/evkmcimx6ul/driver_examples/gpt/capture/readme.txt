Overview
========
The gpt_capture project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK GPT driver's input capture feature.
The example sets up a GPT channel for rise-edge capture. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print the capture value.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX6UL-EVK  board
- JLink Plus
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Both sides of R1728 should be short-circuited.
Connect input signal to J1703-5 pin.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and JLink Plus to the board, switch SW2001 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the J1901 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:
