Overview
========
The WDOG Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK wdog driver.
In this example,implemented to test the wdog.
And then after 10 times of refreshing the watchdog, a timeout reset is generated.
We also try to refresh out of window to trigger reset after 10 times of refreshing.
Please notice that because WDOG control registers are write-once only, so the 
WDOG_Init function and the WDOG_Disable function can be called only once after reset.
