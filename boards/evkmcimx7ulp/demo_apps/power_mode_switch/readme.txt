Overview
========
The Power mode switch demo application demonstrates the use of power modes in the KSDK. The demo prints the power mode menu
through the debug console, where the user can set the MCU to a specific power mode. The user can also set the wakeup
source by following the debug console prompts. The purpose of this demo is to show how to switch between different power
 modes, and how to configure a wakeup source and wakeup the MCU from low power modes.

 Tips:
 This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including:
 - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary.
 - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on.
 - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy.
 - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware.
 - Debug pins(e.g SWD_DIO) would consume addtional power, had better to disable related pins or disconnect them. 


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can support running with Linux BSP! And gcc debug target
exceeds the RAM size so it's not available! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Generate image file with imgutil and write to QSPI flash with U-Boot. For details, please refer to Getting Started with SDK v.2.0 for i.MX 7ULP Derivatives (Doc No: SDK20IMX7ULPGSUG)
5.  Press the reset button on your board to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When running the demo, the debug console shows the menu to command the MCU to the target power mode, or query and set other system power behavior. The power mode switch demo need to run with Linux accordingly, so please make sure the power mode crossings between Cortex-A7 and Cortex-M4 are valid.

NOTE: Only input when the demo asks for input. Input entered at any other time might cause the debug console to overflow and receive the wrong input value.

Remarkable configuration of the application (in power_mode_switch.c):
"SYSTICK_LLWU_WAKEUP":
  The demo leverages LPTMR0 as systick timer, and supports FreeRTOS tickless idle. In tickless idle mode, LPTMR0 takes LPO 1kHz clock as clock source and will overflow in 65 seconds. If setting SYSTICK_LLWU_WAKEUP to "true", it means systick can wake up system in LLS/VLLS so that OS event like task delay or semaphore timeout may wake up SoC in addition to the wakeup source selected in application menu. Even no OS event occurs, the system will be woken up from LLS/VLLS every 65 seconds also to avoid LPTMR0 overflow which leads to systick loss. If setting SYSTICK_LLWU_WAKEUP to "false", then systick(LPTMR0) cannot wakeup SoC in LLS/VLLS.
"APP_ENABLE_GPIO_PAD_LOW_POWER":
  This is an IO low power switch. If setting to "1", then the SoC IO leakage can be optimized with the limitation that only fixed voltage can be applied to the IO pads. Please read "GPIO pads operating range configuration" in Reference Manual SIM module carefully to avoid malfunction or even SoC pad damage.
