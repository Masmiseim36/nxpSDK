Overview
========
The CRC Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to generate checksums
for an ASCII string. Several CRC protocols are implemented using the CRC driver API.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
