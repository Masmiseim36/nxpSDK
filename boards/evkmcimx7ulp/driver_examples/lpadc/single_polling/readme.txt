Overview
========

The lpadc_single_polling example shows the simplest way to use LPADC driver.

In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC's
sample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution 
would check the FIFO valid flag in loop until the flag is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. 
Then read the conversion result value and print it to debug console.

Note, the default setting of initialization for the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can change
the configuration structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.3
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example uses CH6A(J11-7) as LPADC input.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2. Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4. Download the program to the target board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:
