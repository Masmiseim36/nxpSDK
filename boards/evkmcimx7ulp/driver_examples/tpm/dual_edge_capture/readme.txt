Overview
========
The TPM project is a demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver's dual-edge capture feature.
This feature is available only on certain SoC's.
The example sets up a TPM channel-pair for dual-edge capture. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print the capture values and period of the input signal on the terminal window.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.3
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
- Connect input signal to J9-4. Please note both sides of R149 should be short-circuited.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2. Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4. Download the program to the target board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see information from the terminal as below.

Once the input signal is received the input capture values are printed

The input signal's pulse width is calculated from the capture values & printed

Capture value C(n)V=0

Capture value C(n+1)V=26d4

Input signals pulse width=82 us
