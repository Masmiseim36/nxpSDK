Overview
========

The tstmr example shows the usage of TSTMR driver in application. The TSTMR module is a free running incrementing counter that starts running after system reset de-assertion and can be read at any time by the software for determining the software ticks.The TSTMR runs off the 1 MHz clock and resets on every system reset.

In this example, it would output a time stamp information when the application is ready. And then, delay for 1 second with TSTMR_DelayUs() function. Before and after the delay, it would output the two time stamps information again.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, will get the similar messages on the terminal.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Timestamp1 = 01c98d6

 Test the delay function, delay for 1 second

 Start time = 01cb123

 End time = 02bfbd3
