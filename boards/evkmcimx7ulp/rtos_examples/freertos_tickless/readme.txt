Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_tickless example. It shows the CPU enter at sleep mode and then
it is waked up by expired time delay that using GPT module.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will start periodically printing number tick count when the
CPU is running.

Example output like the following shows:

Press any key to start the example
Tickless Demo example
Press or turn on SW3 to wake up the CPU

Tick count :
1
5001
10001
CPU waked up by EXT interrupt
15001
20001
25001

Explanation of the example
The example application will get tick count number after every period time delay vTaskDelay(time)
When this function called the CPU enter to sleep mode a period of time that called by vTaskDelay
function.

While the CPU is sleeping, if several time on board then CPU waked up
by external interrupt and continuous enter sleep mode after complete interrupt service.
The period of time delay is not change after occur external interrupt.
