Overview
========
The asrc_m2m_polling example shows how to use asrc driver with polling:

In this example, one asrc instance convert the audio data stored in flash/SRAM/DDR by polling and then playback through SAI.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8MN6-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer
- Headphone

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Note! ####
This case does not support TCM/Flash targets because of limited memory size.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW101 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the J901 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, you can hear two audio clips, one is 16K, later one is 48K.
The log would be seen on the terminal like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ASRC memory to memory polling example.
Playback original 16K audio data.
Playback converted 48K audio data.
ASRC memory to memory polling example finished.
