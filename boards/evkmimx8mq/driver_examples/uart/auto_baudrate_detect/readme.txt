Overview
========
The uart_auto_baudrate_detect example shows how to use uart auto baud rate detect feature:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart. First, we should send characters a or A to board. 
The boars will set baud rate automatic. After baud rate has set, the board will send back all characters that PC
send to the board.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8MQ6-EVK  board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.



Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW701 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the J1701 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.


Running the demo
================
Set any baud rate in your terminal, and send character a or A to board, then  
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the debug terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UART has detect one character A
Baud rate has been set automatic!
Board will send back received characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
