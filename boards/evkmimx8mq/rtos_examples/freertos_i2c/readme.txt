Overview
========
The freertos_i2c example shows an application using RTOS tasks with I2C driver:

The example may support 2 different connections (it depends on the specific board): 
On board connection and board to board connection.

With one board connection, 2 I2C instances of the same board are used. One i2c instance used as I2C master and another I2C instance used as I2C slave .
    Default settings in freertos_i2c.c (in folder boards\<board>\rtos_examples\freertos_i2c) is applied.
    Two tasks are created. One task is associated with an I2C master operation and another task deals with I2C slave operation.
    1. I2C master task sends data to I2C slave task.
    2. I2C master task reads data sent back from I2C slave task.

    The transmit data and the receive data of both I2C master task and I2C slave task are printed out on terminal.

With board to board connection, one I2C instance on one board is used as I2C master and the I2C instance on other board is used as I2C slave. Tasks are created to run on each board to handle I2C communication.
    File freertos_i2c.c should have following definitions:
    #define EXAMPLE_CONNECT_I2C BOARD_TO_BOARD
    For board used as I2C master:
        #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isMASTER
    For board used as I2C slave:
        #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isSLAVE



Toolchain supported

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8MQ6-EVK  board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Please note only board to board connection is supported, on board connection is not supported.
Transfer data from MASTER_BOARD to SLAVE_BOARD of I2C interface, I2C2 pins of MASTER_BOARD are connected with I2C2 pins of SLAVE_BOARD.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLAVE_BOARD        CONNECTS TO          MASTER_BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name   Board Location
I2C2_SCL       J801-1         I2C2_SCL      J801-1

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW701 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the J1701 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully:
If using 1 board, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below. (Applicable to all boards except TWR-KM34Z75M)



==FreeRTOS I2C example start.==

This example use one i2c instance as master and another as slave on one board.

Master will send data :
