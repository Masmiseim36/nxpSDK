// The sample application 'WaveformGenerator' is focused on the calculation and presentation \
// of dynamic data as graph diagramm by using the Graphics::Path and Views::StrokePath \
// classes.
// 
// Within this example, two data sources ("Channel1" and "Channel2") can be configured \
// to provide a sine, square, ramp or noise signal with a certain amplitude and frequency. \
// These two signals are then added and used to calculate the path of the graph. \
// Each time the signal has changed, the entire path is calulated and the waveform \
// is shown automatically.
// 
// This waveform generator demo and the different assets are designed for a screen \
// size of 320x240 pixels.
//
// You can double-click on the 'Waveform' brick to open the unit within the Composer \
// and to analyze the implementation.
//
// To start the application within the Prototyper, press 'Ctrl'+'F5'.
