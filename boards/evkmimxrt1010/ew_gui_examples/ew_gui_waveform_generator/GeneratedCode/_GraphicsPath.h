/* The class Graphics::Path provides functionality to create and store curve data. 
   Every path object can contain one or more sub-paths. In turn, every sub-path 
   can be individually composed of line segments, Bézier curves, elliptical arcs 
   or even circles. In this manner complex polygons and paths can be constructed 
   easily.
   With the path information the curves can be displayed on the screen. The view 
   Views::FillPath displays the path as filled polygon. The view Views::StrokePath 
   displays the path as a line with specified width.
   The methods of the class Graphics::Paths can be divided in following groups:
   - To specify how many sub-paths the path should be able to manage use the method 
   @SetMaxNoOfSubPaths(). To reserve memory for a sub-path use the method @InitSubPath().
   - With the method @Begin() the start position for a sub-path can be determined 
   or existing sub-path data can be cleared again. In turn, with the method @Close() 
   a sub-path can be closed so its end and start positions appear connected together.
   - Alternatively path data can be loaded from an SVG string by using the method 
   @CreateFromSVGString().
   - With the methods @AddLine(), @AddBezier2(), @AddBezier3() and @AddArc() new 
   line segments or even complex curves are added to the sub-path. With the method 
   @AddCopy() a duplicate of another existing sub-path can be added.
   - With the method @SetNode() the previously prepared sub-path data can be modified. 
   Similarly by using the methods @GetNodeX() and @GetNodeY() the X, Y coordinates 
   stored in the path can be evaluated. The method @ShiftNodes() is convenient to 
   delete old nodes before new nodes are appended.
   - The methods @InitMatrix(), @Translate(), @Scale(), @Rotate(), @PushMatrix() 
   and @PopMatrix() manage a 2D transformation matrix used to convert the original 
   coordinates of the lines and curves when adding them to the path.
   - The methods @GetSubPathBounds() and @GetPathBounds() return the area enlosing 
   all edges of a particular sub-path or of all sub-paths. */

/* The method AddLine() appends between the actual position of the sub-path and 
   the position aX, aY a new straight line segment consisting of one edge. Then 
   the sub-path actual position is adjusted to refer to the end of the just added 
   line segment (aX, aY).
   Within a sub-path the actual position is either the end position of the preceding 
   sub-path segment or it is the value specified in the invocation of the @Begin() 
   method. If the sub-path is empty and no start position has been specified in 
   the preceding @Begin() invocation, the method assumes the origin of the path 
   coordinate system (X=0, Y=0) as the start position for the new line segment.
   The specified position aX, aY is relative to the origin of the path coordinate 
   system. If the path own matrix is not an identity matrix, the corresponding transformations 
   are applied on the position before storing it in the sub-path. See methods @Translate(), 
   @Scale() and @Rotate().
   The method returns the index of the node within the sub-path where the end position 
   of the new line segment has been stored. Knowing this index, the position can 
   be modified later by using the method @SetNode().
   If the sub-path has not been initialized previously by using the method @InitSubPath(), 
   the sub-path has been closed by @Close() method or the entire memory reserved 
   for the sub-path (see parameter aMaxNoOfEdges in the method @InitSubPath()) is 
   already occupied by other edges, the method fails and returns 0.
   The affected sub-path is determined in the parameter aSubPathNo. Within the path 
   all existing sub-paths are numbered starting with the value 0 for the first sub-path, 
   1 for the second and so far. The maximum number of sub-paths the path can manage 
   is determined by the method @SetMaxNoOfSubPaths(). */

/* The method Begin() sets the parameters aX, aY as the start position for the sub-path 
   with the specified number aSubPathNo. The affected sub-path has to be initialized 
   previously by invoking the method @InitSubPath(). Beginning with the specified 
   position, the path can be filled with curve data by using methods like @AddLine(), 
   @AddBezier2(), @AddArc(), etc.
   The specified position aX, aY is relative to the origin of the path coordinate 
   system. If the path own matrix is not an identity matrix, the corresponding transformations 
   are applied on the position before storing it in the sub-path. See methods @Translate(), 
   @Scale() and @Rotate().
   Every sub-path contains exact one start position. Calling this method for a sub-path 
   being already filled with edge coordinates will clear the actual sub-path as 
   if the @InitSubPath() method has been called before.
   Within the path all existing sub-paths are numbered starting with the value 0 
   for the first sub-path, 1 for the second and so far. The maximum number of sub-paths 
   the path can manage is determined by the method @SetMaxNoOfSubPaths(). */

/* The method InitSubPath() prepares the sub-path with the number aSubPathNo to 
   be able to store up to aMaxNoOfEdges path edges (straight line segments). With 
   this operation memory for the sub-path data is reserved. Initially the just initialized 
   sub-path is considered as being empty. To fill the sub-path with data use the 
   methods like @AddLine(), @AddBezier2(), @AddArc(), etc.
   If the affected sub-path has been already initialized in the past, the old information 
   is discarded before initializing the new sub-path. Passing 0 (zero) in the parameter 
   aMaxNoOfEdges results in the old sub-path data being simply released without 
   allocating the memory for the new sub-path.
   If successful, the method returns 'true'. If there is no memory available for 
   the specified number of edges, the method fails and 'false' is returned leaving 
   the sub-path not initialized. Similarly, trying to initialize a sub-path not 
   existing in the path causes the method to return 'false'.
   Within the path all existing sub-paths are numbered starting with the value 0 
   for the first sub-path, 1 for the second and so far. The maximum number of sub-paths

/* The method SetMaxNoOfSubPaths() changes the number of sub-paths the affected 
   path can maximally manage to the specified value aMaxNoOfSubPaths. After modifying 
   its size the affected path is empty. This means all contents of previously existing 
   sub-paths are discarded. Before new path data can be stored in a sub-path the 
   method @InitSubPath() should be called. Please note, if the size of the path 
   does already correspond to the parameter aMaxNoOfSubPaths, the path remains unaffected 
   and retains all existing contents.
   The method returns 'true' if the path could be initialized with the new size. 
   In case, there is no sufficient memory to store the desired number of sub-paths, 
   the method fails and returns 'false' leaving the path empty. */
