Hardware requirements
===================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1015 board
- Headphone
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
- J11, headphone connected

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
===============

Note: This demo uses both headphone mic and board main mic(P1) as input source. The headphone mic provides left
channel data, and main mic (P1) provides right channel data. If users found there is noise while do record operation,
most probably it is the headphone standard issue (OMTP and CTIA standard difference). You should use the OMTP
standard headphone. You can disable the left channel by using an headphone without microphone feature.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like as below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLEXIO_I2S interrupt example started!

FLEXIO_I2S interrupt example finished!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Known issue:
If pressing SW9 to rerun the demo frequently, it may cause booting from QSPI nor flash failed, since the SA1 RXD0 pin is muxed as boot configurations pin.
Workaround: To use SW3 instead of SW9.

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J41.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
