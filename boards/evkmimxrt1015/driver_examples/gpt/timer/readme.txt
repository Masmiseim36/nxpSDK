Overview
========
The gpt_timer project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK GPT driver. It sets up the GPT
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second. When the GPT interrupt is triggered
a message a printed on the UART terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.3
- Keil MDK  5.26
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1
- MCUXpresso  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1015 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press any key to start the example

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J41.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
