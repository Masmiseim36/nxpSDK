Overview
========
The sai_edma_transfer example shows how to use sai driver with EDMA:

In this example, one sai instance playbacks the audio data stored in flash/SRAM using EDMA channel.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1015 board
- Personal Computer
- Headphone

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4. Insert the headphones into the headphone jack on EVK-MIMXRT1015 board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, you can hear the tone and the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SAI example started!
SAI EDMA example finished!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Known issue:
If pressing SW9 to rerun the demo frequently, it may cause booting from QSPI nor flash failed, since the SA1 RXD0 pin is muxed as boot configurations pin.
Workaround: To use SW3 instead of SW9.

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J41.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
