Overview
========
The serial_terminal demo shows how to use emWin library to render text. Connect using serial terminal application to debug console and type text.
Please note that this example does not make use of receive buffer thus this example cannot handle larger amout of text pasted to the terminal at a time.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 24.12.00

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK  5.41
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.60.3
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  24.12.00

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable

Board settings
==============
There are different versions of Adafruit 2.8" TFT LCD shields. The shields marked
v2.0 works directly with this project. For the other shields, please solder
the center pin of IOREF pads to the 3.3V pad, and solder the pads 11, 12, and 13.

- Attach the LCD shield to the board.
- Connect jumper J21
(Note: If we do not connect jumper J21, LCD may not display correctly when debugging 
because it can't get reset signal.)

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Build the project.
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.
