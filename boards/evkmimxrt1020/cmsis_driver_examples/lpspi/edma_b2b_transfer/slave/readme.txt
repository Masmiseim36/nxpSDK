Overview
========
The cmsis_lpspi_edma_b2b_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI CMSIS driver in edma way:

In this example , we need two boards, one board used as LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.
The file 'cmsis_lpspi_edma_b2b_transfer_slave.c' includes the LPSPI slave code.

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in edma . 

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================

Board settings
==============

LPSPI:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       MASTER           connect to           SLAVE
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       J19-4                SIN       J19-5
SIN        J19-5                SOUT      J19-4
SCK        J19-6                SCK       J19-6
PCS0       J19-3                PCS0      J19-3
GND        J19-7                GND       J19-7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LPSPI CMSIS interrupt transfer example start.

This example use one lpspi instance as master and another as slave on one board.

Master uses interrupt way and slave uses interrupt way.

Note that some LPSPI instances interrupt is in INTMUX ,you should set the intmux when you porting this example accordingly

Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:

LPSPI_master -- LPSPI_slave

   CLK      --    CLK

   PCS      --    PCS

   SOUT     --    SIN

   SIN      --    SOUT

This is SlaveSignalEvent.

LPSPI transfer all data matched!

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
