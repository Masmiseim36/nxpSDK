Overview
========

The enet_rxtx example shows the simplest way to use ENET driver for simple 
frame receive and transmit.

1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET MAC.
2. How to use ENET MAC to receive and transmit frame.

The example transmits 20 number broadcast frame, print the frame length, source MAC address
and destination MAC address when receive frame.

Note, The RMII mode is used for default setting to initialize the ENET interface between MAC and the external PHY. you
can change it to MII mode as you wish. Please make sure the MII Mode setting in the MAC is synchronize to the setting
in TWR-SERIAL board for the external PHY.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.5
- Keil MDK  5.31
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Loopback network cable RJ45 standard
- EVK-MIMXRT1020 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert loopback network cable to Ethernet RJ45 port.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Make loopback network cable:
      568B standard 	 Unknowed standard
J1    orange+white       green+white
J2    orange             green
J3    green+white        orange+white
J4    blue               brown+white
J5    blue+white         brown
J6    green              orange
J7	  brown+white        blue
J8    brown              blue+white

Connect J1 => J3, J2 => J6, J4 => J7, J5 => J8. 10/100M transfer only requires J1, J2, J3, J6, and 1G transfer requires all 8 pins.
Check your net cable color order and refer to 568B standard or the other standard. If your cable's color order is not showed in the list,
please connect J1~J8 based on your situation.

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
