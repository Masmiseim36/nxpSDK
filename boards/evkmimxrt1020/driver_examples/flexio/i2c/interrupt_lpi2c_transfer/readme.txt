Overview
========
The flexio_lpi2c_interrupt example shows how to use flexio i2c master  driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated i2c master connect to a LPI2C slave

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1020 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To make this example work, connections needed to be as follows:

    FLEXIO_I2C        connected to  LPI2C1
SCL     J17-2           -->        J18-6
SDA     J17-1           -->        J18-5

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
You can see the similar message shows following in the terminal if the example runs successfully.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FlexIO I2C interrupt - LPI2C interrupt
Master will send data :
0x00  0x01  0x02  0x03  0x04  0x05  0x06  0x07
0x08  0x09  0x0A  0x0B  0x0C

Slave received data :
0x00  0x01  0x02  0x03  0x04  0x05  0x06  0x07
0x08  0x09  0x0A  0x0B  0x0C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Note:

This case use flexio to simulate i2c protocol. 

Owing to this simulate process is software and executed in qspi_flash for flexspi_nor target. 

But external flash's speed can not support to the rate of I2C transmit because of effected by performance. 

So the settings for baudrate of transmission do not more than 200k in this case.


Known Issue: 

Some toolchain flexspi_nor_release target could be print "Error occurred in this transfer !". 
But slave received data is same with master sented, the transfer is ok for this case.

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
