Overview
========
The lpspi_edma_b2b_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI driver in edma way:

In this example , we need two boards, one board used as LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.
The file 'lpspi_edma_b2b_transfer_master.c' includes the LPSPI master code.

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in edma . (LPSPI Slave using edma to receive/send the data)

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.5
- Keil MDK  5.31
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Two EVK-MIMXRT1020 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

SPI one board:
Transfer data from one board instance to another board's instance.
SPI1 pins are connected with SPI1 pins of another board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       MASTER           connect to           SLAVE
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       J19-4                SIN       J19-5
SIN        J19-5                SOUT      J19-4
SCK        J19-6                SCK       J19-6
PCS0       J19-3                PCS0      J19-3
GND        J19-7                GND       J19-7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

LPSPI board to board edma example.
This example use one board as master and another as slave.
Master and slave uses EDMA way. Slave should start first. 
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is: 
LPSPI_master --  LPSPI_slave   
   CLK       --    CLK  
   PCS       --    PCS 
   SOUT      --    SIN  
   SIN       --    SOUT 
   GND       --    GND 

 Master transmit:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F 10
 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 20
 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F 30
 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E 3F 40
This is LPSPI master edma transfer completed callback. 

This is LPSPI master edma transfer completed callback. 

 
LPSPI transfer all data matched! 

 Master received:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F 10
 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 20
 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F 30

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
