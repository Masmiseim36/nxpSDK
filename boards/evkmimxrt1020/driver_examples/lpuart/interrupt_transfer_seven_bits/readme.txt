Overview
========
The lpuart_interrupt_transfer_seven_bits Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver with seven data bits feature enabled.
In the example, you can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console
 in a group of 8 characters.
NOTE: Please set com port format to "7 data bits without parity bit" in PC's com port tool

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1020 board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J17-2
- TX of USB2COM to J17-1
- GND of USB2COM to J19-7

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 7 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal(from USB To Serial Adapter):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lpuart interrupt example with seven data bits
Board receives 8 characters then sends them out
Now please input:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
