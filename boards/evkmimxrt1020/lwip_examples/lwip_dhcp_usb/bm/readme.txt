Overview
========

The lwip_dhcp demo application demonstrates a DHCP and ping demo on the lwIP TCP/IP and USB stack.
The application acts as a DHCP client and prints the status as it is progressing.
Once the interface is being bound to an IP address obtained from DHCP server, address information is printed.
The application will get ip adress www.nxp.com and ping the ip address.
