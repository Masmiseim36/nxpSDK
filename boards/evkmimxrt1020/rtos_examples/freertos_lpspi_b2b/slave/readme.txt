Overview
========
The freertos_lpspi_b2b_slave example shows how to use LPSPI driver in FreeRTOS.
In this example are required two boards, one board is used as LPSPI master on which
is runnuing freertos_lpspi_b2b_master and another board is used as LPSPI slave on which
is running freertos_lpspi_b2b_slave example.

Connection of boards is in section Board settings.

It is required to run first the slave demo.



Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1020 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

SPI one board:
Transfer data from one board instance to another board's instance.
SPI1 pins are connected with SPI1 pins of another board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       MASTER           connect to           SLAVE
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       J19-4                SIN       J19-5
SIN        J19-5                SOUT      J19-4
SCK        J19-6                SCK       J19-6
PCS0       J19-3                PCS0      J19-3
GND        J19-7                GND       J19-7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.



Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
If runs on one single board:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FreeRTOS LPSPI slave example starts.
This example uses two boards to connect with one as master and anohter as slave.
Master and slave are both use interrupt way.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
LPSPI_master -- LPSPI_slave
    CLK      --    CLK
    PCS      --    PCS
    SOUT     --    SIN
    SIN      --    SOUT

LPSPI slave transfer completed successfully.
LPSPI transfer all data matched !
