Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1024-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

To make the example work, connections needed to be as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        SLAVE           connect to      MASTER
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       J19-8                SIN       J18-10
SIN        J19-10               SOUT      J18-12
SCK        J19-12               SCK       J18-6
PCS0       J19-6                PCS0      J18-8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
You can see the similar message shows following in the terminal if the example runs successfully.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLEXIO Master - LPSPI Slave interrupt example start.

This example use one flexio spi as master and one lpspi instance as slave on one board.

Master and slave are both use interrupt way.

Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:

FLEXIO_SPI_master -- LPSPI_slave

      CLK        --    CLK

      PCS        --    PCS

      SOUT       --    SIN

      SIN        --    SOUT

This is LPSPI slave call back.

FLEXIO SPI master <-> LPSPI slave transfer all data matched!

End of example.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
2. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
3. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
