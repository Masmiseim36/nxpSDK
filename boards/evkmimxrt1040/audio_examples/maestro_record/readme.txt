Overview
========
The maestro_demo application demonstrates audio processing on the ARM cortex core
utilizing the Maestro Audio Framework library.

Depending on target platform there are different features of the demo enabled.

    - Loopback from microphone to speaker
    - Recording microphone to a file
    - Wake words + voice commands recognition

The application is controlled by commands from a shell interface using serial console.

Type "help" to see the command list. Similar description will be displayed on serial console:

    >> help

    "help": List all the registered commands

    "exit": Exit program

    "version": Display component versions

    "record_mic": Record MIC audio and either:
     - perform voice recognition (VIT)
     - playback on codec
     - store samples to file.

     USAGE: record_mic [audio|file|<file_name>|vit] 20 [en|cn]
     The number defines length of recording in seconds.
     For voice recognition say supported WakeWord and in 3s frame supported command.
     Please note that this VIT demo is near-field and uses 1 on-board microphone.
     NOTES: This command returns to shell after record finished.
             To store samples to a file, the "file" option can be used to create a file
             with a predefined name, or any file name (without whitespaces) can be specified
             instead of the "file" option.

    "opus_encode": Initializes the streamer with the Opus memory-to-memory pipeline and
    encodes a hardcoded buffer.

For custom VIT model generation (defining own wake words and voice commands) please use https://vit.nxp.com/

Note:
    - If more than one channel is used and VIT is enabled, please enable VoiceSeeker.
        - The VoiceSeeker that combines multiple channels into one must be used, as VIT can only work with one channel.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- JTAG/SWD debugger
- MIMXRT1040-EVK board
- Personal Computer
- Headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack
- Audio expansion board AUD-EXP-42448 (REV B) - optional

Board settings
==============
Please insert the SDCARD into the card slot in order to record to a file
For Audio expansion board:
    1.Insert AUDIO board into J23 if on board codec is not used
    2.Uninstall J41
    3.Define DEMO_CODEC_CS42448 1 in app_definitions.h
    4.Define VOICE_SEEKER_PROC on the project level (see note below)
For on board codec:
    1.Make sure J41 is installed
    2.Define DEMO_CODEC_WM8960 1 in app_definitions.h

Prepare the Demo
================
- As the EVKMIMXRT1040 supports two codecs, a default on board WM8960 codec and another codec CS42448 on audio board, so to support both of the codecs, the example provides options to switch between the two codecs,
  The options are located in the app_definitions.h file.
    - DEMO_CODEC_WM8960, set to 1 if wm8960 is used
    - DEMO_CODEC_CS42448, set to 1 if cs42448 is used
    Please do not set above macros to 1 together, as the demo supports one codec only.

1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the debug USB port (J41) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
Steps for WM8960:
4.  Connect the headphones into the headphone jack on MIMXRT1040-EVK board (J34).
Steps for CS42448:
4. For the loopback (record_mic audio) and for the file output (record_mic file) the audio stream is as follows:
    Stereo INPUT 1 (J12) -> LINE 1&2 OUTPUT (J6)
    Stereo INPUT 2 (J15) -> LINE 3&4 OUTPUT (J7)
    MIC1 & MIC2 (P1, P2) -> LINE 5&6 OUTPUT (J8)
    Insert the headphones into the different line outputs to hear the inputs.
    To use the Stereo INPUT 1, 2, connect an audio source LINE IN jack.
    Please have in mind that the resulting pcm file in case of the file output has following parameters:
    WM8960 codec:  2 channels, 16kHz, 16bit width
    CS42448 codec: 8 channels, 16kHz, 32bit width
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Note:
In order to enable VoiceSeeker it is necessary to add VOICE_SEEKER_PROC to preprocessor defines on project level and either connect the AUD-EXP board or provide another multi-channel data to VoiceSeeker.
Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you should see similar output on the serial terminal as below:
