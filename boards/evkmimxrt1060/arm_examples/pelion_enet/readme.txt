Overview
========
Arm Pelion Device Management example.

The Arm Pelion IoT platform (https://www.pelion.com/) provides connectivity, data and device management for your IoT device.
This example shows you how to add remote device management, such as secure firmware-over-the-air updates, to your IoT device
using the Pelion Device Management Client. By adding this library to your application, you enable:
- Firmware update: Push signed software updates to a large group of devices using update campaigns.
- Cloud connectivity: Send data between your IoT device and cloud service.
- Certificate renewal: Use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to remotely provision device certificates.
- First-to-claim (zero-touch provisioning): Simplify the supply chain by claiming ownership of your device in the field.
