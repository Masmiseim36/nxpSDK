Overview
========
The simple Shadow lightbulb example to illustrate how client application and things communicate with the Shadow service.

- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements

- Personal Computer
- Network cable RJ45 standard (Network with Internet access)

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
Before running the demo it is need to configure AWS IoT Console and update some of project files:

1.  Create AWS Account: https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home

2.  Configure device in the AWS IoT Console base on this guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-sdk-setup.html

    Make note of example's "Thing name" and "REST API endpoint". These strings need to be set in the "aws_clientcredential.h".

    Example:
        static const char clientcredentialMQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT[] = "abcdefgh123456.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com";
        #define clientcredentialIOT_THING_NAME "MyExample"

    In the next step you will get the "device certificate" and the "primary key". The device certificate and private key needs to be opened in text editor and its content copied into the "aws_clientcredential_keys.h".
    Or you can use the CertificateConfigurator.html (mcu-sdk-2.0\rtos\amazon-freertos\tools\certificate_configuration) to generate the "aws_clientcredential_keys.h".

    Example:
        #define keyCLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PEM "Paste client certificate here."

        Needs to be changed to:

        #define keyCLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PEM "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"\
        "MIIDWTCCAkGgAwIBAgIUfmv3zA+JULlMOxmz+upkAzhEkQ0wDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL\n"\
        .
        .
        .
        "mepuT3lKmD0jZupsQ9vLQOA09rMjVMd0YPmI9ozvvWqLpjVvNTKVhsf/3slM\n"\
        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"

    In the same way update the private key array.

3.  This demo doesn't need WiFi network, you can leave the following macros from "aws_clientcredential.h" unmodified.
        #define clientcredentialWIFI_SSID       "Paste WiFi SSID here."
        #define clientcredentialWIFI_PASSWORD   "Paste WiFi password here."

4.  Make sure you have Internet access.

5.  Open example's project and build it.

6.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA port on the target board.

7.  Download the program to the target board with the CMSIS-DAP or J-Link debugger.

8.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

9.  Open a serial terminal on PC for serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the demo in the terminal window. The log can be different based on your local network configuration.
