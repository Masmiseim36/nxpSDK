Overview
========
This project read the h264 files from SD card, decode them and show the frames
in LCD panel.

Prepare the H264 files
Name the H264 files like 000.264, 001.264, 002.264, ..., and save them
to the root path of the SD card. Please starts from 000.264, if there is only one
file, name it as 000.264. This project reads the files one by one and decode.
The recommend file is: https://github.com/cisco/openh264/blob/v2.1.1/res/test_cif_P_CABAC_slice.264
