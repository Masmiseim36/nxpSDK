Overview
========
The EWM Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK EWM driver.
In the example, EWM counter is continuously refreshed until button is pressed.
Once the button is pressed, EWM counter will expire and interrupt will be generated.
After the first pressing, another interrupt can be triggered by pressing button again.
Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1060 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
