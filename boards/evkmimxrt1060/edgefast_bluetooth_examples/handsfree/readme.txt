Overview
========
This example demonstrates the HFP HF basic functionality, the HFP device support be connected to a HFP AG like a mobile phone or a 
board running a HFP AG application. And the HF example support accept/reject/End the incoming call from HFP AG. 



Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- evkmimxrt1060 board
- Personal Computer
- One of the following WiFi modules:
  - AzureWave AW-AM457-uSD

Board settings
==============

Jumper settings for AzureWave AW-AM457-uSD Module:
  - J11 2-3: VIO_SD 3.3V (Voltage level of SDIO pins is 3.3V)
  - J2  1-2: 3.3V VIO_uSD (Power Supply from uSD connector)
  - J4  2-3: 3.3V VIO

The hardware should be reworked according to the hardware rework guide for evkmimxrt1060 and AW-AM457-uSD.

Note:
After downloaded binary into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly, 
please reset the board by pressing SW9 or power off and on the board to run the application.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

4.  Download the program to the target board.

5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
USB Host stack successfully initialized
Bluetooth initialized
BR/EDR set connectable and discoverable done
Please use "Y" to accept the call,  use "N" to reject or end the call
Now Start SDP Service and the Service is now discoverable by remote  device
- Can by connected by HFP AG device like a mobile phone or another device running HFP AG. 
- Outcoming a call or incoming a call in peer HFP AG device.
- In incoming call , user can  be asked to accept or reject the call
- In an active call , user can  be asked to end the call by  input "N"
- Just support adjust the volume by HFP AG part

Note:
There is a short noise can be heard at headset at the begin audio streaming when in running HFP Unit and HFP ring tone   
and at the end of each ring tone segment. The codec power on pop noise cannot eliminate.
