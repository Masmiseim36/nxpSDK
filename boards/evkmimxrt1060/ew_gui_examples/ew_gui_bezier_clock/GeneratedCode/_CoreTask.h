/* The class Core::Task provides the basic functionality for implementing tasks 
   which then can be scheduled for later execution. The execution of tasks is controlled 
   by instances of the class Core::TaskQueue.
   Usually you will use this class to derive your own task class. In your task class 
   you can implement what to do when the task is started, canceled or completed. 
   For this purpose you can override the methods @OnStart(), @OnCancel(), @OnComplete() 
   and @OnContinue().
   It is essential to understand, that the entire 'task' functionality has nothing 
   to do with multi-threading or multi-tasking features known from operating systems. 
   Applications developed with Chora are limited to a single-thread environment. 
   There is no real background thread activity. Accordingly your implementation 
   of a task should behave cooperatively. A well designed task should perform its 
   job quickly, use timers or effects to delay execution and when the job is done 
   reports its completion by calling the method @Complete(). */

   preceding @OnStart() method.

   aQueue refers to the queue this task belonged to. It can be used e.g. to schedule

   default implementation of the method simply cancels the task causing the next 
   available task in the task queue to be started. You should override this method 
   in derived task classes to implement what the task should do.
   There are three typical application cases how to implement the OnStart() method:
   - In its simplest case the entire task algorithm is implemented in the OnStart() 
   method. In this case the method @Complete() should be called before leaving OnStart().
   - If the task does take long time for execution by using timers or effects, you 
   should put in OnStart() the code necessary to start the timers/effects. Don't 
   forget to call @Complete() when all timers/effects are done.
   - If the task is divided in many small execution steps, the OnStart() method 
   should call @Continue() to request the @OnContinue() method to be executed after 
   a short delay (usually after the next screen update). In @OnContinue() you can 
   perform the next step of the task. If necessary, @OnContinue() can also request 
   to be called again after a short delay. At the end of the task, after the last 
   step is terminated, don't forget to call @Complete().
   The parameter aQueue refers to the queue this task belongs to. It can be used 
   to schedule more task to execute later. */

   usually called in context of the @OnStart() or @OnContinue() method when the 
   task has finalized its work. Calling the method for a not current task has no 
   effect. */

   been previously scheduled. In the case the task is already in progress, the queue 
   will advise the task to abort its work immediately before the task is removed 
   from the queue (see @OnCancel()).
   Whether a task is waiting for execution can be determined by @IsScheduled(). 
   Whether a task is in progress can be determined by @IsCurrent().
   Canceling a running task will cause the task queue to start the next available 
   task. */
