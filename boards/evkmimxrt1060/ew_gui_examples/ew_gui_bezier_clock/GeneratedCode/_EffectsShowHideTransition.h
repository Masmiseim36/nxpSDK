/* The class Effects::ShowHideTransition provides functionality for the most primitive 
   fade-in/out operation affecting the pure visibility of a given GUI component. 
   When using the transition for the fade-in operation, the GUI component is automatically 
   arranged to appear (per default centered) within the area of its owner component. 
   This transition is thus ideal wherever one GUI component should instantly appear 
   or disappear in context of another component without any animation effects.
   Per default when the component is displayed, it is aligned in the center of its 
   owner. This can be modified by using the property @Alignment. Furthermore, with 
   the four properties @MarginLeft, @MarginRight, @MarginTop and @MarginBottom the 
   area to align the component within its owner can be limited.
   Please note, with this transition the fade-in operation is performed just at 
   the beginning of all other transitions running simultaneously, in other words, 
   the GUI component appears during the start phase of the transition. In turn, 
   to fade-out the component, the operation is executed during the end phase of 
   the transition. This behavior can be modified by using the properties @ShowAtStart 
   and @HideAtStart. */
