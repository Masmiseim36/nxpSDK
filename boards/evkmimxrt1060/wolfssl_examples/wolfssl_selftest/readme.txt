Overview
========
The wolfssl_selftest demo application demonstrates cryptographic acceleration on supported platforms that have either
an MMCAU or LTC peripheral. The hardware acceleration is enabled by default and can be configured at build time in
the middleware/wolfssl/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h header file. FREESCALE_USE_MMCAU and FREESCALE_USE_LTC macros can
be used to compile the wolfssl_benchmark project source code with support for the Freescale hardware cryptographic
accelerator, or when none of these macros is defined, all algorithms are implemented in software only.


Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.25
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.30.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1060 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.
Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start TeraTerm
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start TeraTerm.

2. New connection -> Serial.

3. Set the appropriate COMx port (where x is port number) in the port context menu. The number is provided by operation
   system and could be different from computer to computer. Select the COM number related to the virtual
   serial port. Confirm the selected port by clicking the "OK" button.

4. Set the following connection parameters in menu Setup -> Serial port.
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: none

5.  Confirm the selected parameters by clicking the "OK" button.

Running the demo
================
The demo prints the system clock frequency and actual hardware acceleration configuration to the terminal,
 then executes cryptographic algorithms. The results are printed to the terminal.
Actual run times may vary significantly depending on the device, its available hardware acceleration modules,
system clock frequency and the compiler used. For software implementations of asymmetric encryption on low performance
MCUs, such as ARM Cortex M0+ @ 40 MHz, the complete tests can take up to 20 minutes.
The middleware/wolfssl/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h header file can be used to enable or disable algorithms of interest at compile time.


Example terminal output:

fsys=120000000
