Overview
========

The adc_polling example shows the simplest way to use adc driver.

In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the adc's
sample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution 
would check the conversion completed flag in loop until the flag is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. 
Then read the conversion result value and print it to debug console.

Note, the default setting of initialization for the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can change
the configuration structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.

The auto-calibration is not essential but strongly recommended. It can help to adjust the converter itself and improve
the adc's performance.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.25
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.30.1
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1064 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
ADC1_IN0 is ADC input. Please sample voltage by J23-2 pin.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
