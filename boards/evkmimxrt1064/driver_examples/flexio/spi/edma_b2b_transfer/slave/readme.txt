Overview
========
The flexio_spi_slave_edma example shows how to use flexio spi slave  driver in dma way:

In this example, a flexio simulated slave connect to a flexio simulated spi master.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Two EVK-MIMXRT1064 boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To make the example work, connections needed to be as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        SLAVE           connect to      MASTER
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       SW5-2                SIN       SW5-3
SIN        SW5-3                SOUT      SW5-2
SCK        SW5-1                SCK       SW5-1
PCS0       SW5-4                PCS0      SW5-4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: Please start up slave example then connect PCS0(SW5-4) and start up master example, 
otherwise the high level signal from master board will affect the boot of slave board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
You can see the similar message shows following in the terminal if the example runs successfully.
