Overview
========
The gpt_capture project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK GPT driver's input capture feature.
The example sets up a GPT channel for rise-edge capture. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print the capture value.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1064 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect input signal to J22-8.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:
