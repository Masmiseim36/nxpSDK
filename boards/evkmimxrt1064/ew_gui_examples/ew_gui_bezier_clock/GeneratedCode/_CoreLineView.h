/* The method ArrangeView() is invoked automatically if the superior @Owner group 
   needs to re-arrange its views. For example, the changing of the owners size can 
   cause the enclosed views to adapt their position and size, so all views still 
   fit within the new owners area. This method provides the core functionality for 
   the automatic GUI layout mechanism.
   The arrangement is controlled primarily by the @Layout property of the view. 
   It specifies a set of alignment constraints and determines whether the view can 
   change its size. The bounds area where the view should be arranged, is passed 
   in the parameter aBounds. This is usually the current area of the views owner.
   The parameter aFormation defines the desired arrangement mode. Depending on the 
   value of this parameter, the views can be arranged in rows or columns. If aFormation 
   == Core::Formation.None, no automatic row/column arrangement is performed and 
   the view is moved and scaled only to fit inside the aBounds area.
   ArrangeView() is invoked automatically by the framework, so you never should 
   need to invoke it directly.
   The method returns the size of the view after it has been arranged. */

/* The method MoveView() changes the position of the view by adding the value aOffset 
   to all corners of the view. For example, in case of a line view the value is 
   added to the both line end points.
   The parameter aFastMove serves for the optimization purpose. If it is 'true', 
   the corners are modified without performing any updates of the view and without 
   redrawing the screen. This is useful, when you wish to move or arrange a lot 
   of views at once. In this case it's up to you to request the finally screen update. 
   To do this you can use the method InvalidateArea() of the views @Owner.
   In the case aFastMove == false, the operation automatically requests the screen 
   redraw of the view areas before and after the movement. You don't need to take 
   care about it. */
