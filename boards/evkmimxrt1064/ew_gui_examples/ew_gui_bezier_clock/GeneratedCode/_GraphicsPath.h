/* The class Graphics::Path provides functionality to create and store curve data. 
   Every path object can contain one or more sub-paths. In turn, every sub-path 
   can be individually composed of line segments, Bézier curves, elliptical arcs 
   or even circles. In this manner complex polygons and paths can be constructed 
   easily.
   With the path information the curves can be displayed on the screen. The view 
   Views::FillPath displays the path as filled polygon. The view Views::StrokePath 
   displays the path as a line with specified width.
   The methods of the class Graphics::Paths can be divided in following groups:
   - To specify how many sub-paths the path should be able to manage use the method 
   @SetMaxNoOfSubPaths(). To reserve memory for a sub-path use the method @InitSubPath().
   - With the method @Begin() the start position for a sub-path can be determined 
   or existing sub-path data can be cleared again. In turn, with the method @Close() 
   a sub-path can be closed so its end and start positions appear connected together.
   - With the methods @AddLine(), @AddBezier2(), @AddBezier3() and @AddArc() new 
   line segments or even complex curves are added to the sub-path. With the method 
   @AddCopy() a duplicate of another existing sub-path can be added.
   - With the method @SetNode() the previously prepared sub-path data can be modified. 
   Similarly by using the methods @GetNodeX() and @GetNodeY() the X, Y coordinates 
   stored in the path can be evaluated. The method @ShiftNodes() is convenient to 
   delete old nodes before new nodes are appended.
   - The methods @InitMatrix(), @Translate(), @Scale(), @Rotate(), @PushMatrix() 
   and @PopMatrix() manage a 2D transformation matrix used to convert the original 
   coordinates of the lines and curves when adding them to the path. */

/* The method AddArc() adds to the sub-path a new elliptical arc composed of exact 
   aNoOfEdges straight line segments. The more edges the more smooth the resulting 
   curve. The center of the ellipse is determined in the parameters aCenterX, aCenterY. 
   The parameters aRadiusX and aRadiusY determine the horizontal and vertical radius 
   of the ellipse. The start and the end angle of the arc is determined in the parameters 
   aStartAngle and aEndAngle, both expressed in degree and measured clockwise relative 
   to the positive X-axis of the path coordinate system.
   If the absolute difference between aStartAngle and aEndAngle is equal to or greater 
   than 360.0, the method calculates with a closed ellipse instead of an opened 
   arc. If the parameters aRadiusX and aRadiusY are equal, the method calculates 
   with a circle instead of an ellipse.
   If the affected sub-path contains already curve information, the end of the last 
   existing segment and the start of the new arc (resulting from the parameter aStartAngle) 
   are connected with an additional straight line segment. Similarly, if start position 
   for the sub-path has been specified by using the @Begin() method, an additional 
   line segment is added to connect the arc with the given sub-path start position. 
   After the elliptical arc curve is added, the sub-path actual position is adjusted 
   to refer to the end of the last line segment of the curve (resulting from the 
   parameter aEndAngle).
   The specified position aX, aY is relative to the origin of the path coordinate 
   system. If the path own matrix is not an identity matrix, the corresponding transformations 
   are applied on the resulting arc segments before storing them in the sub-path. 
   See methods @Translate(), @Scale() and @Rotate().
   The method returns the index of the node within the sub-path where the start 
   position of the first arc line segment has been stored (parameter aStartAngle). 
   Knowing this index and the number of segments the arc curve is composed of (aNoOfEdges), 
   the position of every arc line segment can be modified later by using the method 
   @SetNode().
   If the sub-path has not been initialized previously by using the method @InitSubPath(), 
   the sub-path has been closed by @Close() method or the memory reserved for the 
   sub-path (see parameter aMaxNoOfEdges in the method @InitSubPath()) is occupied 
   by other edges so no sufficient space is available to accommodate aNoOfEdges 
   new segments, the method fails and returns 0.
   The affected sub-path is determined in the parameter aSubPathNo. Within the path 
   all existing sub-paths are numbered starting with the value 0 for the first sub-path, 
   1 for the second and so far. The maximum number of sub-paths the path can manage 
   is determined by the method @SetMaxNoOfSubPaths(). */

/* The method AddBezier3() appends between the actual position of the sub-path and 
   the position aX, aY a new cubic Bézier curve composed of exact aNoOfEdges straight 
   line segments. The more edges the more smooth the resulting curve. The both Bézier 
   curve control points are determined in the parameters aCP1X, aCP1Y and aCP2X, 
   aCP2Y. After the Bézier curve is added, the sub-path actual position is adjusted 
   to refer to the end of the last line segment of the curve (position aX, aY).
   Within a sub-path the actual position is either the end position of the preceding 
   sub-path segment or it is the value specified in the invocation of the @Begin() 
   method. If the sub-path is empty and no start position has been specified in 
   the preceding @Begin() invocation, the method assumes the origin of the path 
   coordinate system (X=0, Y=0) as the start position for the new curve.
   The specified positions aCP1X, aCP1Y, aCP2X, aCP2, aX, aY are relative to the 
   origin of the path coordinate system. If the path own matrix is not an identity 
   matrix, the corresponding transformations are applied on the positions before 
   calculating the Bézier curve and storing the resulting line segments it in the 
   sub-path. See methods @Translate(), @Scale() and @Rotate().
   The method returns the index of the node within the sub-path where the end position 
   of the first Bézier line segment has been stored. Knowing this index and the 
   number of segments the Bézier curve is composed of (parameter aNoOfEdges), the 
   position of every Bézier line segment can be modified later by using the method 
   @SetNode().
   If the sub-path has not been initialized previously by using the method @InitSubPath(), 
   the sub-path has been closed by @Close() method or the memory reserved for the 
   sub-path (see parameter aMaxNoOfEdges in the method @InitSubPath()) is occupied
