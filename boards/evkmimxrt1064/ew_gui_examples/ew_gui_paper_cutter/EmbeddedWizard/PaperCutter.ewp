// The sample application 'PaperCutter' implements the user interface of a paper \
// cutting machine. The user can define the paper format, the paper feed, the number \
// of papers and the speed of the cutting process.
//
// The different parameters are shown within separate small windows. As soon as the \
// user touches on a window, the window is enhanced to host the corresponding settings \
// dialog. Every transition between window and dialog appearance is done with several \
// move and fade-in/fade-out animations.
//
// This demo application is implemented for a screen size of 480x272 pixel.
//
// You can double-click on the 'Cutter' brick to open the unit within the Composer \
// and to analyze the implementation.
//
// To start the application within the Prototyper, press 'Ctrl'+'F5'.
