Overview
========
The SDCARD FATFS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. Tt mounts a file 
system based on a SD card then does "creat directory/read directory/create file/write file/read file"
operation. The file sdhc_config.h has default SDHC configuration which can be adjusted to let card
driver has different performance. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD driver 
based FATFS disk in SDK software.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.3
- Keil MDK  5.27
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.0.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1064 board
- Personal Computer
- SD card

Board settings
==============
Please insert the SDCARD into card slot
Note: 
If you want to use a SD3.0 card with SD3.0 protocol, just insert a SD3.0 card into the card slot will be ok.


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert SD card to card slot 
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FATFS example to demonstrate how to use FATFS with SD card.

Please insert a card into board.
Detected SD card inserted.

Makes file system......This time may be long if the card capacity is big.

Creates directory......
