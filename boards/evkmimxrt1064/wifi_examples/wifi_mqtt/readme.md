# wifi_mqtt

## Overview

The wifi_mqtt demo application demonstrates an MQTT client on the lwIP TCP/IP stack with FreeRTOS.
The board connects to the broker and sends few messages.

Before building the example application select Wi-Fi module macro in the app_config.h. 
(see `#define WIFI_<SoC Name>_BOARD_<Module Name>`).

For more information about Wi-Fi module connection see:
- readme_modules.txt
- [Getting started guide](https://www.nxp.com/document/guide/getting-started-with-nxp-wi-fi-modules-using-i-mx-rt-platform:GS-WIFI-MODULES-IMXRT-PLATFORM)


## Prepare the Demo
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Connect the Wi-Fi module.
4.  Prior building of example you may want to set following symbols:
	- WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD according settings of your AP.
	- EXAMPLE_MQTT_SERVER_HOST and EXAMPLE_MQTT_SERVER_PORT to aim to your broker.
5.  Download the program to the target board.
6.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.


## Running the demo
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
