# lpadc_etc_software_trigger_conv

## Overview

The adc_etc_software_trigger_conv example shows how to use the ADC_ETC to generate a ADC trigger by software trigger.

In this example, the ADC is configured with hardware trigger. Once ADC gets the trigger from the ADC_ETC, the conversion goes,
then the ADC_ETC ISR would be executed.
