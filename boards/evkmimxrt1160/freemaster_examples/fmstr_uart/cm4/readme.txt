Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Target microcontroller board
- Personal Computer
- FreeMASTER 2.5 or later installed on PC

Board settings
============
No special settings are required. By default this demo communicates over a virtual 
serial line interface of the debugger USB connection. With a proper RS232 transceiver
and pin configuration, it may also connect to microcontroller UART peripheral.

Multi-core considerations
=========================
There are example applications prepared for both CM4 and CM7 cores of the RT116x target platform. 
The debugger is typically able to load and run the code on any of the cores, but only one core 
is default (CM7) and will run automatically after reset. This means that the flash-based targets 
(and both Debug and Release targets on MCUXpresso IDE) are only usable on the default core.

Prepare the demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug USB port on the target board.
2.  Compile and download the program to the target microcontroller.
3.  Run and resume application execution when debugger stops in the main() function.

Connect with FreeMASTER
=======================
4.  Run FreeMASTER, use the Connection Wizard or open Project Options.
5.  Select serial communication, choose correct COMx port and connect at speed 115200 bps.
6.  Start communication, FreeMASTER loads the initial TSA Active Content links in the Welcome page.
7.  Click the "FreeMASTER Demonstration Project (embedded in device)" in the Welcome page.
8.  The demo is now running, you should be able to watch variable values and graphs.
