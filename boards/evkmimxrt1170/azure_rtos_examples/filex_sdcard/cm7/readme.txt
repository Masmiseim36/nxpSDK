Overview
========
The example shows how to use the SD card middleware with Azure RTOS.

This example will print the information of the SD card and format it
in FAT format. Then, do some file operation test - create, write,
read, close and so on.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVK board
- Personal Computer
- Micro SD card

Board settings
==============
Please make sure R136 is welded for GPIO card detect.
Please insert a micro SD card into the card slot.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Insert a micro SD card into the card slot
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
3.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
