Overview
========
The mco_manager/mcofd_manager example implements a minimal CANopen Manager.
It produces a cyclic heartbeat message (701h) and waits for 
CANopen Slave devices with a node ID in the range of 2 to 10.
Once a CiA 401 compatible generic I/O device is found,
the manager echos data received by the 401 device.

NOTE: For more details, please see the User's Manual for the
EmSA CANopen (FD) Libraries for NXP SDKs.


Implementation Description
Node-ID: 0x01, Baudrate: 500kbps

Messages produced (by CAN ID):
0x000       - NMT Master command message
0x602-0x60A - SDO requests to nodes 2 to 10
0x701       - Heartbeat (default 333ms)
Once a CiA 401 device is found with node ID nid:
0x200+nid   - RPDO1 of nid - Total of 4 input Bytes
    [6000h,1] Digital in byte 1: 0
    [6000h,2] Digital in byte 2: 0
    [6000h,3] Digital in byte 3: copy/echo of [6200h,1] Digital out byte 1
    [6000h,4] Digital in byte 4: copy/echo of [6200h,2] Digital out byte 2
0x300+nid   - RPDO2 of nid - Two 16-bit analog inputs
    [6401h,1] Analog out word16 1: timer with hi byte seconds and lo byte quarter seconds
    [6401h,2] Analog out word16 2: copy/echo of [6411h,2] Analog out word16 1

Messages consumed (by CAN ID):
0x082-0x0AA - Emergencies of nodes 2 to 10
0x582-0x58A - SDO responses to nodes 2 to 10
0x702-0x70A - Bootup and heartbeats of nodes 2 to 10
Once a CiA 401 device is found with node ID nid:
0x180+nid   - TPDO1 of nid - Four bytes of digital outputs. 
0x280+nid   - TPDO2 of nid - Two 16-bit analog outputs.

User can use a CAN monitor (USB CAN analysis) to probe the CAN frame transfered.
- CANL in CAN USB analysis connected with CANL in two board by shunt-wound method.
- CANH in CAN USB analysis connected with CANH in two board by shunt-wound method.
- (optinal) GND in CAN USB analysis connected with GND in two board by shunt-wound method.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Two mini/micro USB cables
- Two MIMXRT1170-EVK boards with J47 pin header connector populated
- CAN cabling with pin header female connectors 
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires 2 sets of boards, each of them with the J47 header pin connector populated.
Using dupont wires, connect all 3 pins of both boards with each other.
Pin 1 to pin 1 (CAN_Hi), pin 2 to pin 2 (GND) and pin 3 to pin 3 (CAN_Lo).

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
1. First press the reset button on the board with the mco_slave example
2. Second press the reset button on the board with the mco_manager example
