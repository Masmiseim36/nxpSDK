===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVK board
- JLink Plus
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer
- RK055MHD091 panel or RK055AHD091 panel or RK055IQH091 panel
- SD card

Board settings
==============
1. Connect the RK055MHD091-CTG LCD board to J48.
2. Unzip the pics.zip, place the jpg pictures to the SD card.
3. Please make sure R136 is weld for GPIO card detect and then insert the SDCARD into card slot(J15).


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Build the project, the project uses RK055MHD091 by default, to use other panels,
    change
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055MHD091
    to
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055IQH091
    or
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055AHD091
    in display_support.h.
3.	Insert SD card to card slot
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
