- Keil MDK  5.34
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- evkmimxrt1170 board
- Personal Computer
- One of the following modules:
  - AzureWave AW-AM457-uSD
  - AzureWave AW-CM358-uSD

Board settings
==============
Before building the example application select Wi-Fi module macro in the app_config.h. (see #define WIFI_<SoC Name>_BOARD_<Module Name>).
If you want use the AzureWave WIFI_IW416_BOARD_AW_AM457_USD, please change the macro to WIFI_IW416_BOARD_AW_AM457_USD.
If you want use the AzureWave WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_AW_CM358MA-M.2, please change the macro to WIFI_88W8987_BOARD_AW_CM358MA.

Jumper settings for RT1170:
remove  J38 5-6
connect J38 1-2
connect J43 with external power(controlled by SW5)

Jumper settings for AzureWave AW-AM457-uSD Module:
  - J11 2-3: VIO_SD 3.3V (Voltage level of SDIO pins is 3.3V)
  - J2  1-2: 3.3V VIO_uSD (Power Supply from uSD connector)
  - J4  2-3: 3.3V VIO

The hardware should be reworked according to the hardware rework guide for evkmimxrt1170 and AW-AM457-uSD in document Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL.
The pin connect for UART HCI as the following table,
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PIN NAME | AW-AM457-USD |   I.MXRT1170  | PIN NAME OF RT1170 | GPIO NAME OF RT1170
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UART_TXD |  J10(pin 4)  |   J25(pin 13)   |    LPUART7_RXD     | GPIO_AD_01
UART_RXD |  J10(pin 2)  |   J25(pin 15)   |    LPUART7_TXD     | GPIO_AD_00
UART_CTS |  J10(pin 8)  |   J25(pin 9)    |    LPUART7_RTS     | GPIO_AD_03
UART_RTS |  J10(pin 6)  |   J25(pin 11)   |    LPUART7_CTS     | GPIO_AD_02
GND      |  J6(pin 7)   |   J26(pin 1)    |    GND             | GND

The hardware should be reworked according to the hardware rework guide for evkmimxrt1170 and AW-CM358-M.2 in document Hardware Rework Guide for EdgeFast BT PAL.

Note:
After downloaded binary into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly,
please reset the board by pressing SW4 or power off and on the board to run the application.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Provide 5V voltage for the target board.

4.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

5.  Download the program to the target board.

6.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the example in the terminal window.
