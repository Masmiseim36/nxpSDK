Overview
========
This example demonstrates how the Wi-Fi of the board can be configred by Android mobile application, and publish the Wi-Fi AP information to the AWS IoT.
AWS Wi-Fi provisioning example will start advertising if the Wi-Fi AP is not configured and wait the Wi-Fi AP configuration. After connected to the Android APK,
the example will execute the request from cellphone and reply the response. When the Wi-Fi AP is configured, the Shadow demo will connect to the AWS via Wi-Fi and 
publish the configured Wi-Fi AP information.
Note: This example could NOT function with the default setting provided in SDK package because an AWS account is mandatory to run to the example, 
the end users must create their owner AWS account and configure the IoT Console before the functionality of the example could be used. Also, 
some information specified by the end customers, like Thing name, broker endpoint, etc., must be updated accordingly before the example would work. 
Check "Prepare the Demo" to get the detailed guidance of the configuration steps. 
To make sure the NVM area have clean, all flash sector need be erased before download demo code.

Prepare the Demo
================
Before running the example it is need to configure AWS IoT Console and update some of project files:

1. Create AWS Account: https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home

2. To create an AWS IOT policy based on the guide : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-prereqs.html.

a. To create an IAM policy, you need to know your AWS Region and AWS account number.
   To find your AWS account number, open the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/), locate and expand the menu beneath your account name in the upper-right corner, and choose "My Account". Your account ID is displayed under "Account Settings".
   To find the AWS region for your AWS account, use the AWS Command Line Interface. To install the AWS CLI, follow the instructions in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html). After you install the AWS CLI, open a command prompt window and enter the following command:
   aws iot describe-endpoint
   The output should look like this:
   {
    "endpointAddress": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
   }
   In this example, the region is us-west-2.
   If the AWS Region is not set, please set the region in AWS IoT console(https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
b. Browse to the AWS IoT console(https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
c. In the navigation pane, choose "Secure", choose "Policies", and then choose "Create".
d. Enter a name to identify your policy. For example, the policy name is "aws_wifi_provisioning_policy".
e. In the Add statements section, choose "Advanced mode". Copy and paste the following JSON into the policy editor window.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
f. Choose "Create".

3. To create an IoT thing, private key, and certificate for your device based on the guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/ble-demo.html. For more information about setting up, see the Getting Started with AWS IoT (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html).

a. Open the "AWS IoT console"(https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/), and from the navigation pane, choose "Manage", and then choose "Things".
b. Choose "Create", and then choose "Create a single thing".
c. Enter a name for your device, and then choose "Next". For example, the thing name is "aws_wifi_provisioning". Note, the max length of thing name cannot more than 23.
d. If you are connecting your microcontroller to the cloud through a mobile device, choose "Create thing without certificate". Because the Mobile SDKs use Amazon Cognito for device authentication, you do not need to create a device certificate for demos that use Bluetooth Low Energy. If you are connecting your microcontroller to the cloud directly over Wi-Fi, choose "Create certificate", choose "Activate", and then download the thing's certificate, public key, and private key. 
Due to the microcontroller connecting AWS cloud directly over Wi-Fi in the example, choose choose "Create certificate", choose "Activate", and then "download" the thing's certificate, public key, and private key.
e. Choose "Attach a policy" to attach a policy to your certificate that grants your device access to AWS IoT operations.
f. Choose the policy you just created and choose Register thing. Such as, choose the policy "aws_wifi_provisioning_policy" created in step 2.d. 
g. Choose the thing that you just created from the list of registered things, and then choose "Interact" from your thing's page. Make a note of the AWS IoT REST API endpoint.

4. To configure your AWS IoT endpoint based on the guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-prereqs.html
You need to provide FreeRTOS with your AWS IoT endpoint so the application running on your board can send requests to the correct endpoint.
a. Browse to the AWS IoT console(https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/).
b. In the navigation pane, choose "Settings".
   Your AWS IoT endpoint is displayed in "Endpoint". It should look like 1234567890123-ats.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com. Make a note of this endpoint.
c. In the navigation pane, choose "Manage", and then choose "Things". Your device should have an AWS IoT thing name. Make a note of this name. Such as, the thing name "aws_wifi_provisioning" created in  step 3.c.
d. Open <MCUXpresso SDK>/rtos/freertos/demos/include/aws_clientcredential.h.
e. Specify values for the following constants:
   o #define clientcredentialMQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT "Your AWS IoT endpoint"
   o #define clientcredentialIOT_THING_NAME "The AWS IoT thing name of your board"

5. To format your AWS IoT credentials based on the guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-prereqs.html
FreeRTOS needs the AWS IoT certificate and private keys associated with your registered thing and its permissions policies to successfully communicate with AWS IoT on behalf of your device.
FreeRTOS is a C language project, and the certificate and private key must be specially formatted to be added to the project.
a. In a browser window, open <MCUXpresso SDK>/rtos/freertos/tools/certificate_configuration/CertificateConfigurator.html.
b. Under "Certificate PEM file", choose the ID-certificate.pem.crt that you downloaded from the AWS IoT console.
c. Under "Private Key PEM file", choose the ID-private.pem.key that you downloaded from the AWS IoT console.
d. Choose "Generate and save aws_clientcredential_keys.h", and then save the file in <MCUXpresso SDK>/rtos/freertos/demos/include. This overwrites the existing file in the directory.
Note, The certificate and private key are hard-coded for demonstration purposes only. Production-level applications should store these files in a secure location.

6.  Open example's project and build it.

7.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

8.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

9.  Download the program to the target board.

10.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

         "Action":[
            "iot:AttachPolicy",
            "iot:AttachPrincipalPolicy",
            "iot:Connect",
            "iot:Publish",
            "iot:Subscribe",
            "iot:Receive",
            "iot:GetThingShadow",
            "iot:UpdateThingShadow",
            "iot:DeleteThingShadow"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "*"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
d. Choose "Review policy", enter a name for the policy, and then choose "Create policy".
e. The same steps for unauthenticated identity's role.

    More information on AWS IoT policies can be found here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorization.html

4.  Prepare "aws_wifi_provisioning.properties" file with yours AWS credentials. It's structure looks like this:

    customer_specific_endpoint=<REST API ENDPOINT>
    cognito_pool_id=<COGNITO POOL ID>
    thing_name=<THING NAME>
    region=<REGION>
    policy_name=<POLICY>

    For example:
    customer_specific_endpoint=xxxxxx-ats.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
    cognito_pool_id=us-west-2:5xxxx7-3xxxx9-4xxx5-axxf-0xxxxxxxxxxb
    thing_name=aws_wifi_provisioning
    region=us-west-2
    policy_name=aws_wifi_provisioning_policy

    Then move properties file into your Android device (application will ask for properties file though file browser dialog during first run).

5.  To run Android application as the following, 
    o Update the configuration. Please refer to the documents of FreeRTOS BLE Mobile SDK for Android (<MCUXpresso SDK>\boards\<board name>\edgefast_bluetooth_examples\wifi_provisioning\amazon-freertos-ble-android-sdk\README.md and <MCUXpresso SDK>\boards\<board name>\edgefast_bluetooth_examples\wifi_provisioning\amazon-freertos-ble-android-sdk\app\README.md) for porject setting firstly.

There are some limitations for the example,
1. Only one wifi network configuration could be saved. Please view the ticket https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/issues/2678 for detail information.
2. The building warnings on IAR and arm gcc tool-chain. Please view the ticket https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/issues/2638 for detail information.
3. Once the wifi network is configured, the BLE will be disconnected and then disabled. So the BLE connection could not be established after the WIFI configured successfully.
4. If the log "[wm_wlan] Connection Failed !" following the 3 times log "[wm_wlan] Connect to AP FAIL ! Retrying .....", it means the wifi network is not established. Please check whether the entered passkey is correct, whether WIFI AP is working, or whether the example is blocked by blacklist or whitelist. And then retry again.
5. If the blank screen is shown when start running the APK, it maybe the network issue. Please view the ticket https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos-ble-android-sdk/issues/34 for detail information.
