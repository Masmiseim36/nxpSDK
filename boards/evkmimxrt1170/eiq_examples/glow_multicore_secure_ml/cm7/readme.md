Overview
========
Enable multicore support for Glow machine learning security  for Microcontrollers

The inference process is run on Cortex-M7 core, and  capture the image data  is run
on Cortex-M4 core. M7 core starts up first and loads M4 core image into SDRAM (0x20200000),
then M4 core starts up using the image in SDRAM.


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- Keil MDK  5.38.1
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1170 board
- Personal computer
- RK055AHD091 or RK055MHD091 display (optional)
- OV5640 camera (optional)

Board settings
==============
Connect the display to J48 (optional)
Connect the camera to J2 (optional)
Connect external 5V power to J43, set J38 to 1-2

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Build the project. (The project expects the RK055MHD091 panel by default. To use the RK055AHD091 panel,
    change #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055MHD091 to #define DEMO_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055AHD091
    in eiq_display_conf.h.)
4. Download the program to the target board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
