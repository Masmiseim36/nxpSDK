Overview
========
This GUI demo is developed with the Embedded Wizard GUI solution.

The application demonstrates the usage of vector graphics created from svg
path data and how transitions between two design variations and further ui
components can be achieved.

The application provides the following screens / operation modes:
- A start screen with a start engine button which can be activated to perform
the transition
to the dashboard.
- A dashboard screen handling the presentation and animation of different
elements.
- Two variations of gauges for speedometer and energy level.

This examples runs bare metal, but Embedded Wizard is also possible
to use with FreeRTOS. Our official Build Environments, that can be downloaded
as described above, includes examples and demos that illustrate the integration
of FreeRTOS and can be used for your reference.



In order create your own GUI application powered by the latest version of
Embedded Wizard that is suitable for the i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit, please
visit https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/getting-started-mimxrt1170-evk

For this example a simulation of the user interface is also available.
It can be used under following link
http://www.embedded-wizard.de/NXP-SDK-Examples/IMXRT1170-EVK/Dashboard/Simulation/
with any web browser. The simulation uses the JS/WebGL Embedded Wizard Platform Package.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVK board
- Personal Computer
- RK055MHD091 panel or RK055AHD091 panel or RK055IQH091 panel

Board settings
==============
1. Connect the LCD panel to J48.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Build the project, the project uses RK055MHD091 by default, to use other panels, change #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055MHD091 to #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055IQH091 or #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055AHD091 in display_support.h.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
If this example runs correctly, the sample application is displayed on the LCD screen.
The log below shows the output of the sample application 'Dashboard' in the terminal window:
