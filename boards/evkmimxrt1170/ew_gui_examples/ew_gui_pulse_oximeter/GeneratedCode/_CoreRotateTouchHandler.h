/* The class Core::RotateTouchHandler provides a special kind of a view able to 
   react to touch screen events and to recognize rotation gestures. Each time the 
   user taps inside the area of the handler and drags the finger around its center 
   (resulting from the property @CenterOffset), the handler sends signals to the 
   slot method stored in the property @OnRotate. The intention of this handler is 
   to cover the internal aspects of the cursor event handling. 
   The handler provides several variables useful to query e.g. the current handler 
   state (@Down), or the current rotation angle (@Angle), etc. These variables can 
   be simply evaluated in the implementation of the slot method.
   The property @Enabled can be used to activate/deactivate the touch handler. Disabled 
   handler will not react to user taps.
   With the properties @RetargetCondition, @RetargetOffset and @RetargetDelay the 
   handler can be configured to automatically deflect the current event processing 
   to another handler as soon as the user has performed a simple gesture, e.g. wipe 
   down. Using these properties several handler can cooperate during an active user 
   interaction even if these handler overlap each other. For example, one handler 
   can process horizontal gestures while another handler will limit to vertical 
   gestures, etc.
   The handler can be configured to react to multi-touch gestures performed by two 
   or more fingers. In such case the expected number of fingers can be specified 
   in the property @NoOfFingers. With the property @LimitToFinger the handler can 
   be limited to react to events generated by a particular finger only.
   Due to its ancestry from the Core::View class, the touch handler can be arranged 
   within its @Owner or if @Embedded == 'true' within the boundary area of an Core::Outline 
   view in the same manner as it is done with all regular views.
   The touch handler itself is invisible except the Embedded Wizard Composer, where 
   all handler appear as semitransparent rectangles with a cross at the resulting 
   center position. This allows you to interact with the handlers during the design 
   time. */

/* The method Draw() is invoked automatically if parts of the view should be redrawn 
   on the screen. This can occur when e.g. the view has been moved or the appearance 
   of the view has changed before.
   Draw() is invoked automatically by the framework, you never will need to invoke 
   this method directly. However you can request an invocation of this method by 
   calling the method InvalidateArea() of the views @Owner. Usually this is also 
   unnecessary unless you are developing your own view.
   The passed parameters determine the drawing destination aCanvas and the area 
   to redraw aClip in the coordinate space of the canvas. The parameter aOffset 
   contains the displacement between the origin of the views owner and the origin 
   of the canvas. You will need it to convert views coordinates into these of the 
   canvas.
   The parameter aOpacity contains the opacity descended from this view's @Owner. 
   It lies in range 0 .. 255. If the view implements its own 'Opacity', 'Color', 
   etc. properties, the Draw() method should calculate the resulting real opacity 
   by mixing the values of these properties with the one passed in aOpacity parameter.
   The parameter aBlend contains the blending mode descended from this view's @Owner. 
   It determines, whether the view should be drawn with alpha-blending active or 
   not. If aBlend is false, the outputs of the view should overwrite the corresponding 
   pixel in the drawing destination aCanvas. If aBlend is true, the outputs should 
   be mixed with the pixel already stored in aCanvas. For this purpose all Graphics 
   Engine functions provide a parameter to specify the mode for the respective drawing 
   operation. If the view implements its own 'Blend' property, the Draw() method 
   should calculate the resulting real blend mode by using logical AND operation 
   of the value of the property and the one passed in aBlend parameter. */

/* The method HandleEvent() is invoked automatically if the view has received an 
   event. For example, touching the view on the touch screen can cause the view 
   to receive a Core::CursorEvent event. Within this method the view can evaluate 
   the event and react to it.
   Whether the event has been handled by the view or not is determined by the return 
   value. To sign an event as handled HandleEvent() should return a valid object 
   (e.g. 'this'). If the event has not been handled, 'null' should be returned.
   Depending on the kind of the event, the framework can continue dispatching of 
   still unhandled events. For example, keyboard events (Core::KeyEvent class) are 
   automatically delivered to the superior @Owner of the receiver view if this view 
   has ignored the event.
   HandleEvent() is invoked automatically by the framework, so you never should 
   need to invoke it directly. However you can prepare and post new events by using 
   the methods DispatchEvent() and BroadcastEvent() of the application class Core::Root. */

  aEvent );

/* The method CursorHitTest() is invoked automatically in order to determine whether 
   the view is interested in the receipt of cursor events or not. This method will 
   be invoked immediately after the user has tapped the visible area of the view. 
   If the view is not interested in the cursor event, the framework repeats this 
   procedure for the next behind view until a willing view has been found or all 
   views are evaluated.
   In the implementation of the method the view can evaluate the passed aArea parameter. 
   It determines the place where the user has tapped the view with his fingertip 
   expressed in the coordinates of the views @Owner. The method can test e.g. whether 
   the tapped area does intersect any touchable areas within the view, etc. The 
   affected finger is identified in the parameter aFinger. The first finger (or 
   the first mouse device button) has the number 0.
   The parameter aStrikeCount determines how many times the same area has been tapped 
   in series. This is useful to detect series of multiple touches, e.g. in case 
   of the double click, aStrikeCount == 2.
   The parameter aDedicatedView, if it is not 'null', restricts the event to be 
   handled by this view only. If aDedicatedView == null, no special restriction 
   exists.
   This method is also invoked if during an existing grab cycle the current target 
   view has decided to resign and deflect the cursor events to another view. This 
   is usually the case after the user has performed a gesture the current target 
   view is not interested to process. Thereupon, the system looks for another view 
   willing to take over the cursor event processing after the performed gesture. 
   Which gesture has caused the operation, is specified in the parameter aRetargetReason.
   If the view is willing to process the event, the method should create, initialize 
   and return a new Core::CursorHit object. This object identify the willing view. 
   Otherwise the method should return 'null'.
   CursorHitTest() is invoked automatically by the framework, so you never should 
   need to invoke it directly. This method is predetermined for the hit-test only. 
   The proper processing of events should take place in the @HandleEvent() method 
   by reacting to Core::CursorEvent and Core::DragEvent events. */
