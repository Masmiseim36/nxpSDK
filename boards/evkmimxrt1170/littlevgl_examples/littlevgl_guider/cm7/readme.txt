    - No flow control
3.  Build the project, the project uses RK055AHD091 by default, to use panel RK055IQH091,
    change the macro DEMO_PANEL to DEMO_PANEL_RK055IQH091 in display_support.h,
    change LV_HOR_RES_MAX to 540, LV_VER_RES_MAX to 960 in guider_lv_conf.h.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
