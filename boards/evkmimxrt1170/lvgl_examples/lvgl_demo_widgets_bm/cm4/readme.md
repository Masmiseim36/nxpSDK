Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Build the project, the project uses RK055MHD091 by default, to use other panels,
    change
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055MHD091
    to
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055IQH091
    or
    #define DEMO_PANEL DEMO_PANEL_RK055AHD091
    in display_support.h.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
If this example runs correctly, the sample GUI is displayed.

This board also supports LVGL 1-bit and 8-bit color depth, to use this feature, modify
DEMO_USE_XRGB8888 as 0, modify DEMO_USE_LUT8 as 1 in display_support.h. Modify
LV_COLOR_DEPTH as 1 or 8 in lv_conf.h.

Currently GPU is not supported for 1-bit and 8-bit color depth, change LV_USE_GPU_NXP_PXP
and LV_USE_GPU_NXP_VG_LITE to 0 in lv_conf.h.
