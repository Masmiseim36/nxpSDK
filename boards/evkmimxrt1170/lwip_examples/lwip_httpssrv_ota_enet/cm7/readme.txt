Overview
========

The lwip_httpsrv_ota_freertos demo application demonstrates OTA update through HTTPServer set up on lwIP TCP/IP and the MbedTLS stack with
FreeRTOS. The user uses an Internet browser to upload new version of firmware and restarts the board to perform the update


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Network cable RJ45 standard
- MIMXRT1170-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example uses 1G port(J4) as default. If want to test 100M port(J3), please set the macro BOARD_NETWORK_USE_100M_ENET_PORT to 1.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. The demo requires MCUBoot bootloader to be present in the FLASH memory to function properly.
   It is recommended to build and program the bootloader first, then go on with the application.
   Please refer to respective readme of the mcuboot_opensource example and follow the steps there before you continue.
2. Prior launching the demo it is recommended to pre-build image with modified version of the application to test the OTA update process.
3. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA(or USB to Serial) USB port on the target board.
4. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial(or USB to Serial) device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
5. Insert the Ethernet Cable into the target board's RJ45 port and connect it to your PC network adapter.
6. Configure the host PC IP address to 192.168.0.100.

Running the demo
================
Platform specific behavior:
When an application programmatically performs software-induced reset while in a debugging session, the execution stalls in the ROM code. This is a feature.
Your attention is needed at that moment: please perform reset manually by pressing the on-board hw reset button once you spot "SystemReset" message in the serial console.
Manual reset is not needed while MCU is running freely without a debugger.
