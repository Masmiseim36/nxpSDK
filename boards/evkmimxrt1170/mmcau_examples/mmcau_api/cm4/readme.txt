Overview
========
Memory-Mapped Cryptographic Acceleration Unit (MMCAU)

This project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software for encryption/decryption sample
data using AES-CBC, DES3-CBC and Hash algorithms MD5, SHA1 and SHA256.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Testing input string: 
          Once upon a midnight dreary,
           while I pondered weak and weary,
          Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
          While I nodded,
           nearly napping,
           suddenly there came a tapping,
          As of some one gently rapping,
           rapping at my chamber doorIts some visitor,
           I muttered,
           tapping at my chamber doorOnly this,
           and nothing more.
