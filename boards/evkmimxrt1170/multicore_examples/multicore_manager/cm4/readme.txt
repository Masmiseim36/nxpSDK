Overview
========
The Multicore Manager example application demonstrates advanced features of the MCMgr component.
In this demo, the primary core prints the "Hello World from the Primary Core!" string to the terminal
and then releases the secondary core from the reset. The secondary
core toggles an on-board LED indicating that the secondary core is running. It is also possible to
stop/start the secondary core during the runtime by pressing on-board buttons. The
on-board LED then indicates the change, it stops/starts toggling accordingly.

This application also shows how to use the Multicore Manager for
remote core monitoring and handling of events such as application, CoreUp, CoreDown and exception events.
Application-specific callback functions for events are registered by the MCMGR_RegisterEvent() API
on the primary core. Triggering these events is done using the MCMGR_TriggerEvent() API on the
secondary core. While CoreUp, CoreDown events are triggered from startup and MCMGR code, the
application event is triggered from the application.
The exception event is triggered in the secondary application after 100 LED toggles by trying
to write to flash. This raises the exception on the secondary core and triggers the
RemoteExceptionEvent on the primary core.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.10.2
- Keil MDK  5.34
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.5.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the hello world multicore demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello World from the Primary Core!

Copy Secondary core image to address: 0x20200000, size: 3280
Starting Secondary core.
The secondary core application has been started.

Press the SW7 button to toggle Secondary core Start/Stop.
When no action is taken the secondary core application crashes intentionally after 100 LED toggles (simulated exception), generating the RemoteExceptionEvent to this core.
Use the Stop and then the Start button to get it running again.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note:
The "Copy Secondary core image to address..." log message is not displayed on the terminal window when MCUXpresso IDE is used.
In case of MCUXpresso IDE the secondary core image is copied to the target memory during startup automatically.

Note:
To download binary of cm7 core into qspiflash and boot from qspiflash directly, following steps are needed:
1. Compile flash target of the project, and get the binaray file "hello_world.bin".
3. Set the SW1: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J11.
4. Drop the binaray into disk "RT1170-EVK" on PC.
5. Wait for the disk disappear and appear again which will take couple of seconds.
7. Reset the board by pressing SW3 or power off and on the board. 
(If default boot core is cm4, binary of cm4 could be downloaded and boot according to steps above.)

Note:
To download and debug IAR EW project using J-Link (replacing the default CMSIS-DAP debug probe), following steps are needed:
1. Remove J6 and J7 jumpers.
2. Attach the J-Link probe (J-Link Plus / J-Trace) to the board using the J1 connector.
3. Set "J-Link / J-Trace" in CM7 project options -> Debugger -> Setup panel (replacing CMSIS-DAP option).
4. Unselect the "Use macro file(s)" in CM7 project options -> Debugger -> Setup panel.
5. Enable "Use command line options" in CM7 project options -> Debugger -> Extra Options panel 
   (--jlink_script_file=$PROJ_DIR$/../evkmimxrt1170_connect_cm4_cm7side.jlinkscript command line option is applied).
5. Click on "Download and Debug" button. During the loading process you can be asked by J-Link sw
   to select the proper device name (MIMXRT1176XXXA_M7 is unknown). Click O.K. and choose the MIMXRT1176xxxxA device.
6. It is not possible to attach to the CM4 core when using the J-Link. Also, the multicore debugging does not work with that probe.

Note:
To download and debug Keil MDK project using J-Link (replacing the default CMSIS-DAP debug probe), following steps are needed:
1. Remove J6 and J7 jumpers.
2. Attach the J-Link probe (J-Link Plus / J-Trace) to the board using the J1 connector.
3. Set "J-LINK / J-TRACE Cortex" in CM7 project options -> Debug panel (replacing CMSIS-DAP Debugger option).
4. After the CM7 application build click on Download/F8 button (menu Flash -> Download).
5. Power off and power on the board.
6. Multicore example starts running, one can start debugging the CM7 side by clicking on Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl + F5). 
7. It is not possible to attach to the CM4 core when using the J-Link.
