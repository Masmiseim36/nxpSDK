Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1180-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
To make this example work, connections needed to be as follows:

    FLEXIO_PIN        connected to  RGPIO
PIN0     J69-3           -->        J69-4

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the MCULink USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
