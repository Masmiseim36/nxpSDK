# lpit_pwm

## Overview
This demo show how to use SDK drivers to implement the PWM feature by LPIT IP module in 
dual 16-bit Periodic counter mode,and clone by TRGMUX to output this PWM to TRGMUX_OUTx pin.
By default,the pwm duty is 50%, user can input from terminal to
change the period and duty cycle,use oscilloscope can measure this output PWM signal.
