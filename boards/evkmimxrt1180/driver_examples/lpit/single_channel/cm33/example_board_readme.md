3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below but you can't see LED toggled on the board
because there is no led connected on the MCIMX7ULP-EVK board .
