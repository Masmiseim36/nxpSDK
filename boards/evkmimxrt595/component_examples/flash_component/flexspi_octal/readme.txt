Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Note 1:
If you use adesto octal flash, it will spend much more time to chip erase(about 10 minutes for 128MB),
and block erase(5 seconds) also much longer than others from different vendors.
