Overview
========
The OSTIMER project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK OSTIMER driver. It sets the OSTIMER as
the wakeup source from deep-sleep mode. Board will enter power deep sleep mode, and then wakeup by OS timer after about 5 seconds.
After wakeup from deep-sleep mode, OS timer will set match value 
to trigger the interrupt while the timer count tick reach the match value about every 2 seconds.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT595 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J40) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
