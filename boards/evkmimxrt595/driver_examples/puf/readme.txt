Overview
========
The PUF Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software implement secure key storage using PUF software driver.

Usual use consists of these steps:
1. 	Enroll: The controller retrieves the Startup Data (SD) from the memory (SRAM), derives a digital fingerprint, 
	generates the corresponding Activation Code (AC) and sends it to the storage system. 
	Perform this step only once for each device. There is a control register that can block further enrollment. 
	This control register is write only and is reset on a power-on reset.

2. 	Start: The AC generated during the enroll operation and the SD are used to reconstruct the digital fingerprint. 
	It is done after every power-up and reset.

3. 	Generate Key: The controller generates an unique key and combines it with the digital fingerprint to output a key code. 
	Each time a Generate Key operation is executed a new unique key is generated.

4. 	Set Key: The digital fingerprint generated during the Enroll/Start operations and the key provided by the Client Design (CD) 
	are used to generate a Key Code. This KC can be stored externally. Perform this operation only once for each key.

5. 	Get Key: The digital fingerprint generated during the Start operation and the KC generated during a Set Key operation 
	are used to retrieve a stored key. Perform this operation every time a key is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J40) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the PUF driver example in the terminal window (the key value will vary):
