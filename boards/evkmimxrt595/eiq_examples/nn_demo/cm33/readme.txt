Overview
========

The dsp_nn_demo demo application demonstrates starting DSP core with DSP image and accelerating some neural networks layers using the DSP.
This demo will just call some routines to offload Neural Networks processing on the HiFi4. The example calls are these:
ECHO: Just a round-trip
CONV DS: Convolution depthwise
CONV STD: Convolution standard
RELU: Rectified Linear Unit
MAXPOOL: Max Pooling
All the layer examples are executed in 2 flavours: synchronous and asynchronous.


Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- JTAG/SWD
- evkmimxrt595 board
- Personal Computer

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program for CM33 core to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
5.  Detach from board.
6.  Download the program for DSP core to the target board.
7.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo CM33
=====================
When the demo runs successfully, the terminal will display the following:
