Overview
========
Xtensa Audio Framework example with TensorFlow Lite Micro word detection
recognizing 4 categories: "silence", "unknown", "yes", "no".


Toolchain supported
===================
- Xtensa Xplorer  9.0.18
- Xtensa C Compiler  14.01

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT595 board
- Personal computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Build the Fusion F1 project first to create the binary image.
2. Replace the DSP binary files in the Cortex-M33 project with the files
   generated into the <example_root>/fusionf1/binary directory if necessary.
3. Continue with the Cortex-M33 master project.
4. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
5. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
6. Download the program to the target board.
7. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
