- USB A to micro AB cable
- Hardware (Tower module/base board, and so on) for a specific device
- Personal Computer (PC)


### Software requirements

- The project files for lite version example are in:
<br> <MCUXpresso_SDK_Install>/boards/<board>/usb_examples/usb_device_video_virtual_camera_lite/<rtos>/<toolchain>.
<br>  For non-lite version example, the path is:
<br> <MCUXpresso_SDK_Install>/boards/<board>/usb_examples/usb_device_video_virtual_camera/<rtos>/<toolchain>.
