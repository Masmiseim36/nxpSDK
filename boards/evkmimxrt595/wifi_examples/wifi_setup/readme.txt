Overview
========
This is a simpe wifi setup demo.

Before building the example application select Wi-Fi module macro in the app_config.h. (see #define WIFI_<SoC Name>_BOARD_<Module Name>).
For more information about Wi-Fi module connection see:
    readme_modules.txt

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT595 board
- Personal Computer
- USB/UART converter (3.3V logic level)


Board settings
==============
JP4: 1-2

Debug console UART is configured to use pins of J27, connect the board with PC by USB/UART converter:
- board UART RX (pin 1 on J27) - connect to TX pin on converter
- board UART TX (pin 2 on J27) - connect to RX pin on converter
- board GND (pin 7 on J29) - connect to GND pin on converter

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Connect the WiFi module to SD card slot.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.


Running the demo
================
1. Adjust the SSID and PASSPHRASE definition to fit your wifi network and adjust the ping address definitions.
2. After wifi is initialized, it'll try to scan nearby networks. After the scan results appear press any key to continue.
3. Wifi will now try to connect to the defined network. After that you'll be one more time prompted to press any key.
