Overview
========
The extram loader application provides an example of a small loader running in SoC internal memory,
which is able to initialize the external RAM controller and load the other application to external
memory and kick off it.
The loader itself is built to run in internal memory, and the application to be loaded is built to
run in external RAM. They are combined with elftosb tool. On system reset, ROM loads them as a single
image into SoC internal memory, and starts the loader. Then the loader will load the secondary
application and kick off it to run in external memory.

- Keil MDK  5.29
- MCUXpresso  11.1.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT685 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============


Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
2. Example boards\evkmimxrt685\component_examples\mpi_loader\extram_hello_world should be built and we can then
   get extram_hello_world.bin.
3. Build this example, and we can get extram_loader.bin.
4. Copy all those binaries to elf2sb workspace "input_images" folder identified in mpi_loader_ram.json.
5. Copy mpi_loader_ram.json to elf2sb workspace "image_config" folder.
6. Execute elf2sb.exe with mpi_loader_ram.json as parameter. E.g.,
   - elftosb.exe -V -d -f rt6xx -J workspace/image_config/mpi_loader_ram.json
7. In elf2sb workspace "output_images" folder, you can get the multicore packed image mpi_loader_extram_hello_world.bin.
8. Write flash config block to flash offset 0x400 (address 0x08000400) and write mpi_loader_extram_hello_world.bin to
   flash offset 0x1000 (address 0x08001000). E.g. with blhost tool, set board boot mode DIP to Serial ISP
   [high, high, low], reset the board and use command window to communicate with it (need to identify the COM port).
   - blhost.exe -p COM29 -- fill-memory 0x1c000 4 0xc1500051
   - blhost.exe -p COM29 -- fill-memory 0x1c004 4 0x20000008
   - blhost.exe -p COM29 -- configure-memory 9 0x1c000
   - blhost.exe -p COM29 -t 100000 -- flash-erase-region 0x08000000 0x100000
   - blhost.exe -p COM29 -- fill-memory 0x1d000 4 0xf000000f
   - blhost.exe -p COM29 -- configure-memory 0x9 0x1d000
   - blhost.exe -p COM29 -- write-memory 0x08001000 workspace\output_images\mpi_loader_extram_hello_world.bin
9. Set board boot mode to flash portb boot [low, high, low]
10. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
11. Reset the board and you will see the result.

Running the demo CM33
=====================
When the demo runs successfully, the terminal will display the following:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Loading finished, now enter external RAM application.
hello world.
