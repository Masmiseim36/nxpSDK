Overview
========

The lpadc_single_polling example shows the simplest way to use LPADC driver.

In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC's
sample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution 
would check the FIFO valid flag in loop until the flag is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. 
Then read the conversion result value and print it to debug console.

Note, the default setting of initialization for the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can change
the configuration structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT685 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
- Set VREF_L to GND, VREF_H to 1.8V (connect JP9, JP10).
- Input voltage signal(0~1.8V) to J30-1(LPADC0 CH0).

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:
