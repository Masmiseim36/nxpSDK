Overview
========
This example demonstrates usage of eRPC between PC and board using UART transport layer.
Board acts like a client and the PC as server. When client starts, it generates two random
matrixes and sends them to server. Server then performs matrix multiplication and sends
result data back to client. Result matrix is then printed on the PC side.

PC Side Setup (Python)
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your PC
2. Install serial module by executing following command in command line: "python -m pip install pyserial"
3. Install eRPC module to Python by executing setup.py located in: middleware\multicore\erpc\erpc_python - "python setup.py install"

Usage of run_uart.py
usage: run_uart.py [-h] [-c] [-s] [-p PORT] [-b BD]

eRPC Matrix Multiply example

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message an
  -c, --client          Run client
  -s, --server          Run server
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Serial port
  -b BD, --bd BD        Baud rate (default value is 115200)

Either server or client has to be selected to run

Example:
To run PC side as a server with a board connected as a client to COM3 execute:
"run_uart.py --server --port COM3"

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-K22F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the USB port on the target board.
2.  Download the erpc_client_matrix_multiply_uart example to the target board.
3.  Start server on PC first.
4.  Then start execution of client example loaded in board to begin running the demo.

For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log can be captured on the PC side (python console).
The matrix multiplication can be issued repeatedly when pressing a SW board button.
