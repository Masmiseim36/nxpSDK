Overview
========
This example demonstrates usage of eRPC between two boards using SPI transport layer.
One board acts like a server and the second as client. When client starts, it generates two random
matrixes and sends them to server. Server then performs matrix multiplication and sends
result data back to client. Client then prints the result matrix.

Optional HW setup is to use the PC as the eRPC client and the board as the eRPC server. In this case
the LIBUSBSIOSPITransport (Python) is used on the PC side and the SPI slave transport on the board side.
The libusbsio Python module is used for accessing the NXP libusbsio APIs and thus allowing to exercise SPI, I2C bus and GPIO pins 
from Python application (over USBSIO interface of NXP LPCLink2 and MCUlink Pro devices). 
This configuration is supported for selected boards only. Note, that when more than one board with LPCLink2/MCUlink devices
is connected to the PC the Python application is not able to automatically detect which one to use to establish the communication. Thus, please
ensure only one board with running eRPC server application is connected to the PC when starting the Python application on the PC side 
or use the -d command line argument of the Python application to specify the targetted LPCLink2/MCUlink device index.

PC Side Setup (Optional for PC-to-board communication)
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your PC
2. Install serial module by executing following command in command line: "python -m pip install pyserial"
3. Install eRPC module to Python by executing setup.py located in: middleware\multicore\erpc\erpc_python - "python setup.py install"
4. Install libusbsio module to Python by executing following command in command line: "python -m pip install libusbsio==2.1.0"

usage: run_spi.py [-h] [-b BD] [-g CS_PORT] [-p CS_PIN] [-d DEVIDX]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit
  -b BD, --bd BD                Baud rate (default value is 500000)
  -g CS_PORT, --csport CS_PORT  Chip select GPIO port number (see the board schematics)
  -p CS_PIN, --cspin CS_PIN     Chip select GPIO pin number (see the board schematics)
  -d DEVIDX, --devidx DEVIDX    LIBUSBSIO device index (default value is 0 - only one board connected to the host PC)

Example:
To run PC side as a client with a board connected as a server:
"run_spi.py --bd 500000 --csport 0 --cspin 15"

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-K22F board
- Another FRDM-K22F board or any other supported board to communicate with
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect SPI signals on client board to the SPI signals on server board. Basicaly, the connection is:
   Client      |     Server
---------------------------------
   SOUT(MOSI)  --    SIN(MOSI)
   SIN(MISO)   --    SOUT(MISO)
   SCK(CLK)    --    SCK(CLK)
   PCS         --    PCS
   SLAVE_READY --    SLAVE_READY
   GND         --    GND

SPI signals for FRDM-K22F board:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTANCE0(SPI0)
Pin Name      Board Location
SIN           J1 pin 11
SOUT          J1 pin 16
SCK           J1 pin 15
PCS           J24 pin 9
SLAVE_READY   J24 pin 12
GND           J2 pin 14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect all SPI signals, SLAVE_READY and GND between client and server board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download server program to first target board.
5.  Download client program to the second target board.
6.  Start server first.
7.  Start client to begin running the demo.

For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.
