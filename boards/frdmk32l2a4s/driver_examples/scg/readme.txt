Overview
========

The SCG example shows how to use SCG driver:

 1. How to setup the SCG clock source.
 2. How to use SCG clock while power mode switch.
 3. How to use SCG APIs to get clock frequency.

This example prints the clock frequency through the terminal using the SDK driver.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-K32L2A4S board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This demo prints through the OpenSDA serial port, don't need special board setting.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port (J13) on frdmk32l2a4s board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo. For detailed instructions, see Getting Started with Software Development Kit for
   K32L2A (document SDKK32L2AGSUG).

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, will get the following messages on the OpenSDA terminal.
