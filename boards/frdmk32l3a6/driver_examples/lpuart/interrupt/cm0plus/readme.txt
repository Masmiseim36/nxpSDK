Overview
========
The lpuart_functioncal_interrupt example shows how to use lpuart driver functional
API to receive data with interrupt method:

In this example, one lpuart instance connect to PC, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.3
- Keil MDK  5.27
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K32L3A6 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
