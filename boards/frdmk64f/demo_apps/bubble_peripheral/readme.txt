Overview
========
The bubble level demo demonstrates basic usage of the on-board accelerometer to implement a bubble level. A bubble
level utilizes two axes to visually show deviation from a level plane (0 degrees) on a given axis.


Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K64F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar
information from the terminal as shown below.


Welcome to the BUBBLE example

You will see the change of LED brightness on board and angle data in the console when change the angles of board

x=  6 y = 22
x=  8 y = 26
x= 10 y = 28
x= 10 y = 28
x= 11 y = 29
x= 11 y = 29
