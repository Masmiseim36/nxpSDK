Overview
========

The dac_basic example shows how to use DAC module simply as the general DAC converter.

When the DAC's buffer feature is not enabled, the first item of the buffer is used as the DAC output data register.
The converter would always output the value of the first item. In this example, it gets the value from terminal,
outputs the DAC output voltage through DAC output pin.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.10.2
- Keil MDK  5.34
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.4.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K64F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
5.  A multimeter may be used to measure the DAC output voltage.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

DAC basic Example.
Please input a value (0 - 4095) to output with DAC: 200
Input value is 200
DAC out: 200

Then user can measure the DAC output pin to check responding voltage.
