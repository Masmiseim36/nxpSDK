Overview
========
The PIT project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK PIT driver. It sets up the PIT
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second. When the PIT interrupt is triggered
a message a printed on the UART terminal and an LED is toggled on the board.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-K64F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting channel No.0 ...
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occured !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occured !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occured !
....................
....................
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And you will find the LED RED is taking turns to shine.
