Overview
========
The uart_hardware_flow_control example project is to demonstrate usage of the hardware flow control function.
This example will send data to itself(loopback), and hardware flow control will be enabled in the example.
The CTS(clear-to-send) pin is for transmiter to check if receiver is ready, if the CTS pin is assert, transmiter start
to send data. The RTS(request-to-send) is a pin for receiver to inform the transmiter if receiver is ready to receive
data. So, please connect RTS to CTS pin directly.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.3
- Keil MDK 5.23
- GCC ARM Embedded 6-2017-q2
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso10.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-K64F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
UART hardware flow control on one board.
The UART will send data to itself(loopback), and hardware flow control function will be 
enabled on this example. So, please makesure the correct connection for example.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pin Name   Board Location    connect to      Pin Name    Board Location
UART_TX    J2  Pin 4         ----------      UART_RX    J1  pin 16
UART_CTS   J1  Pin 14        ----------      UART_RTS   J1  Pin 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is UART hardware flow control example on one board.
This example will send data to itself and will use hardware flow control to avoid the overflow.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is: 
      UART_TX    --     UART_RX    
      UART_RTS   --     UART_CTS   
Data matched! Transfer successfully.
