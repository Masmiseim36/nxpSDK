Overview
========
The serial_terminal demo shows how to use emWin library to render text. Connect using serial terminal application to debug console and type text.
Please note that this example does not make use of receive buffer thus this example cannot handle larger amout of text pasted to the terminal at a time.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K64F board
- Adafruit TFT LCD shield w/Cap Touch
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Attach the LCD shield to the FRDM board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Build the project.
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
Known issue: The MCU is not able to generate hardware reset of the LCD due to hardware limitation of the boards interconnection.
Because of this the LCD may not get initialized (stays blank) following a cold start (power on) of the board even if the demo was
correctly programmed to the FLASH memory. In such a case simply press the reset button to restart the demo.
