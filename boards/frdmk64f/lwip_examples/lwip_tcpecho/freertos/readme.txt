Overview
========

The lwip_tcpecho demo application demonstrates a TCP echo demo on the lwIP TCP/IP stack with bare metal KSDK or
FreeRTOS. The demo uses the TCP protocol and acts as an echo server. The application sends back the received TCP
packets from the PC, which can be used to test whether a TCP connection is available.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- RJ45 Network cable
- FRDM-K64F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA(or USB to Serial) USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial(or USB to Serial) device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Insert the Ethernet Cable into the target board's RJ45 port and connect it to your PC network adapter.
4.  Configure the host PC IP address to 192.168.0.100.
5.  Download the program to the target board.
7.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
1. When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
