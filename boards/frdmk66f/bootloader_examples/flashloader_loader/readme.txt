Overview
========
Flashloader_loader is a bootstrap loader that executes from flash memory on either the Freedom or Tower platform. This loader copies an image of the flashloader into RAM, then executes the flashloader from RAM.

Software requirements
=====================
The flashloader_loader project uses the output of the flashloader build to create the flashloader image to load into RAM. So, the flashloader project must be built before building the flashloader_loader project. Also, Python27 needs to be installed for successful flashloader image generation.

Known issue:
This example cannot be imported into Config Tools because it doesn't contain files generated by config tool.
