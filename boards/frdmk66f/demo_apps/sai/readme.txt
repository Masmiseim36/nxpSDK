Overview
========
The SAI Demo application demonstrates complicated digital audio playback and record case. The demo provide these features below:
1. Duplex audio transfer, record and playback at same time.
2. Playback a 250 Hz sine wave data generated by CMSIS-DSP library. Also compute the fundamental frequency using Fast Fourier Transform with CMSIS-DSP library.
3. Record a 5 seconds audio to sdcard with a FatFs system. After record, playback it. This feature may only existed in platform which support sdhc.
Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-K66F board
- Personal Computer
- Headphones
- Line-in line
- Sdcard

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Insert the headphones into the headphone jack on FRDM-K66F board (J28). Insert line-in line into J29.
5. Insert sdcard to board.
6. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SAI Demo started!

Please insert a card into board.

Make file system......The time may be long if the card capacity is big.

Create directory......

Please choose the option :
1. Record and playback at same time
2. Playback sine wave
3. Record to SDcard, after record plyaback it
5. Quit
