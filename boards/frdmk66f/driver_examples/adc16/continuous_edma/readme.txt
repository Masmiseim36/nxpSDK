Overview
========
The ADC16 continuous EDMA demo application demonstrates the usage of the ADC and EDMA peripheral while in a continuous mode. The
ADC16 is first set to continuous mode. In continuous convert configuration, only the initial rising-edge to launch continuous conversions is
observed, and until conversion is aborted, the ADC16 continues to do conversions on the same SCn register that initiated the conversion. 
EDMA request will be asserted during an ADC16 conversion complete event noted when any of the SC1n[COCO] flags is asserted. EDMA will transfer
ADC16 results to memory and if users press any key, demo will average ADC16 results stored in memory and print average on the terminal.  

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K66F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Connect external signal source to user-defined channel, defined by "DEMO_ADC16_CHANNEL" in source code. 
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
