Overview
========
The CRC Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to generate checksums
for an ASCII string. Several CRC protocols are implemented using the CRC driver API.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-K66F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.
Running the demo
================
Example output on terminal:
