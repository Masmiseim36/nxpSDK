Overview
========
The dspi_half_duplex_edma_transfer_slave example shows how to receive and transmit data to master board.

Notice: The SPI slave of this example uses edma mode. The data transfer size(not buffer size) is twice of
the master's transfer size. The first half of the transmission will receive data, and the second half will send
data back to master, so the begain address of the receive buffer is &rxDataPolling[64].

In this example, one spi instance as slave and another spi instance on the other board as master. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
master is correct. And slave will print what it received.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Two FRDM-K66F boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI one board:
Transfer data from one instance to anther instance on the other board.
Note: Please separate the connected wires(especially the SCK wire), if not, 
      mixed wires may caused electromagnetic interference and data will transfer error.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
