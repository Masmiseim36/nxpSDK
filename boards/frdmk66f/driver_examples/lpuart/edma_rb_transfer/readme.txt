Overview
========
The lpuart_edma Ring Buffer Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver.
In the example, a ring buffer will be used with EDMA enabled, data received will be stored in ring 
buffer first, while IDLE line was detected, routine will read out the received characters, and echo back
them to the terminal by using EDMA mode. so, you can see the your pressed characters on the terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K66F board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J1-13
- TX of USB2COM to J1-9
- GND of USB2COM to J2-14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the PC host and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the LPUART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
