Overview
========
The WDOG Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK wdog driver.
In this example,quick test is first implemented to test the wdog.
And then after 10 times of refreshing the watchdog in None-window mode, a timeout reset is generated.
We also try to refresh out of window to trigger reset after 10 times of refreshing in Window mode.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- J-Link ARM
- FRDM-K66F board
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
