Overview
========
The SDCARD FATFS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. Tt mounts a file 
system based on a SD card then does "creat directory/read directory/create file/write file/read file"
operation. The file sdhc_config.h has default SDHC configuration which can be adjusted to let card
driver has different performance. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD driver 
based FATFS disk in SDK software.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-K66F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The SDCARD FATFS example  is configured to use SDHC0 with PTE0, PTE1, PTE2, PTE3, PTE4, PTE5 pins
and use PTD10 pin as card detection pin.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
FATFS example to demonstrate how to use FATFS with SD card.

Please insert a card into board.

Card inserted.

Make file system......The time may be long if the card capacity is big.

Create directory......

Create a file in that directory......

Create a directory in that directory......

List the file in that directory......
General file : F_1.DAT.
Directory file : DIR_2.

Write/read file until encounters error......

Write to above created file.
Read from above created file.
Compare the read/write content......
The read/write content is consistent.

Input 'q' to quit read/write.
Input other char to read/write file again.
