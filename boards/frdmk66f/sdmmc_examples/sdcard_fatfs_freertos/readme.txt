Overview
========
The SDCARD FatFs FreeRTOS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It reads/writes
/erases the SD card continuously. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD driver
with FatFs and freeRTOS in SDK software to access SD card.
Note: The output log of the case is not constant, since difference of card access speed and platform will affect the behavior of card access task.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- Keil MDK  5.33
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-K66F board
- Personal Computer
- SD card

Board settings
==============
Insert the card into the card slot

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port (J2) on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Insert sdcard into card slot.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
