Overview
========

The pdb_dac_trigger example shows how to use the PDB to generate a DAC trigger.

Based on the basic counter, to use the DAC trigger, just to enable the DAC trigger's "milestone" and set the user-
defined value for it.
The DAC's "milestone" is called as "interval". Multiple DAC trigger intervals can be included into one PDB counter's cycle.
DAC trigger's counter would reset after the trigger is created and start counting again to the interval value.

In this example, the DAC is configured with hardware buffer enabled in normal work mode. Once it gets the trigger from 
the PDB, the buffer read pointer increases.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.50.1
- Keil MDK 5.17
- GCC ARM Embedded 2015-4.9-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.0.0
- Atollic TrueSTUDIO 5.4.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K82F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
