Overview
========
The WDOG8 Example project is to demonstrate usage of the wdog8 driver.
In this example, fast testing is first implemented to test the wdog8.
After this, refreshing the watchdog in None-window mode and window mode is executed.
Note wdog8 is disabled in SystemInit function which means wdog8 is disabled
after chip emerges from reset.
