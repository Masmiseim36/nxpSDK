Overview
========

The adc12_polling example shows the simplest way to use ADC12 driver.

In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the ADC12's sample input.
When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution would check the conversion completed flag in loop until the flag is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. Then read the conversion result value and print it to debug console.

Note, the default setting of initialization for the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can change the
configuration structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.

The auto-calibration is not essential but strongly recommended. It can help to adjust the converter itself and improve the
ADC12's performance.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- FRDM-KE15Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project uses ADC12 instance 0 to sample and convert the voltage signal input from channel 0(PTA0).
So the voltage signal input from PTA0 should be changed to observe the dynamical conversion result.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the OpenSDA terminal:
