Overview
========
The flexio_spi_slave_edma_lpspi_master example shows how to use flexio spi slave driver in edma way:

In this example, a flexio simulated slave connect to a lpspi master.



Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- FRDM-KE15Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires connecting the FLEXIO pins with the LPSPI pins
The connection should be set as following:
       SLAVE           connect to      MASTER
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
SOUT       J2 pin 8             SIN       J21 pin 8
SIN        J2 pin 10            SOUT      J21 pin 7
SCK        J2 pin 12            SCK       J21 pin 6
PCS3       J2 pin 6             PCS3      J21 pin 5

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LPSPI Master interrupt - FLEXIO SPI Slave edma example start.

This example use one lpspi instance as master and one flexio spi slave on one board.

Master uses interrupt and slave uses edma way.

Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:

LPSPI_master -- FLEXIO_SPI_slave

   CLK      --    CLK

   PCS      --    PCS

   SOUT     --    SIN

   SIN      --    SOUT

This is FLEXIO SPI slave call back.

LPSPI master <-> FLEXIO SPI slave transfer all data matched!

End of Example.
