Overview
========
The tsi_v5_mutual_cap example shows how to use TSI_V5 driver in mutual-cap mode:

In this example , we make use of the available electrodes on board to show driver usage.
1. Firstly, we get the non-touch calibration results as baseline electrode counter;
2. Then, we start the Software-Trigger scan using polling method and interrupt method;
3. Then, we start the Hardware-Trigger scan using interrupt method.
