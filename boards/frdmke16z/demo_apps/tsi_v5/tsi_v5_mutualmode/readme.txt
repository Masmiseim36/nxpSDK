Overview
========
The tsi_v5_mutualmode demo shows how to use TSI_V5 driver in mutual-cap mode:

In this example , available electrodes on FRDM-TOUCH board are used to show how to realize touch key.
1. Firstly, get the non-touch calibration results as baseline electrode counter;
2. Then, start the periodical Software-Trigger scan using polling method to detect finger touch;
3. Wait for the electrodes touched and deal with the event.

Running the demo
================
When running successfully, LED will be turned on when the electrode on FRDM-TOUCH board is touched
and the LED will be turned off after the electrode is released. 
The log output in terminal shall be similar as below:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
