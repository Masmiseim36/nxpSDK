Overview
========
The tsi_v5_mutual_cap example shows how to use TSI_V5 driver in mutual-cap mode:

In this example , we make use of the available electrodes on board to show driver usage.
1. Firstly, we get the non-touch calibration results as baseline electrode counter;
2. Then, we start the Software-Trigger scan using polling method and interrupt method;
3. Then, we start the Hardware-Trigger scan using interrupt method.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TSI_V5 Mutual-Cap mode Example Start!

Please do not touch pad KEY3 when in calibration process!
Calibrated counters for mutual-cap pad KEY3 is: 2600 

NOW, comes to the software trigger scan using polling method!
Mutual-cap pad KEY3 Normal mode counter is: 2600 

NOW, comes to the software trigger scan using interrupt method!
Mutual-cap pad KEY3 Normal mode counter is: 2600 

NOW, comes to the hardware trigger scan method!
After running, touch pad KEY3 each time, you will see LED toggles
