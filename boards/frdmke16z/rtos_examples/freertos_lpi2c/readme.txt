Overview
========
The LPI2C Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate the Low Power Inter-
Integrated Circuit.
The example uses two instances of LPI2C, one in configured as master and the other one as slave.
The LPI2C master sends data to LPI2C slave. The slave will check the data it receives and shows the log.

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- FRDM-KE16Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
LPI2C two boards:
Transfer data from one board's instance to another board's instance.
LPI2C0 pins are connected with LPI2C0 pins of another board.
To make this example work, connections needed to be as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTANCE(LPI2C0)    connected to   INSTANCE (LPI2C0)
Pin Name   Board Location        Pin Name    Board Location
LPI2C0_SCL   J2-20              LPI2C0_SCL   J2-20
LPI2C0_SDA   J2-18              LPI2C0_SDA   J2-18
GND          J2-14              GND          J2-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In file freertos_lpi2c.c, do following definition:
            #define EXAMPLE_CONNECT_I2C BOARD_TO_BOARD
            For master, use following definition
                #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isMASTER
                Build project.
                Download the program to one target board (used as master board).
            For slave, use following definition
                #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isSLAVE
                Build project.
                Download the program to one target board (used as slave board). 
            Note: Slave side should run before Master side.
            
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
