Overview
========
The spi_interrupt_b2b_master example shows how to use spi functional API to do interrupt transfer as a master:

In this example, the spi instance as master. Master sends a piece of data to slave, receive data from slave,and check
if the data master received is correct. This example needs to work with spi_interrupt_b2b_slave example.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.3
- Keil MDK 5.23
- GCC ARM Embedded 6-2017-q2
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso10.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-KL02Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI board to board:
Transfers data through the instance 0 of the SPI interface. SPI0 pins of the master board are
connected to the SPI0 pins of the slave board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPI board to board interrupt master example started!

SPI transfer finished!
