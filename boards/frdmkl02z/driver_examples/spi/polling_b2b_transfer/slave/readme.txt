Overview
========
The spi_polling_board2board_slave example shows how to use spi driver as slave to do board to board transfer with
polling:

Notice: The SPI slave of this example uses interrupt mode, as there is no polling mode for SPI slave.

In this example, one spi instance as slave and another spi instance on other board as master. Master sends a piece of
data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from master is correct.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.3
- Keil MDK 5.23
- GCC ARM Embedded 6-2017-q2
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso10.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-KL02Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI board to board:
Transfers data through the instance 0 of the SPI interface. SPI0 pins of the master board are
connected to the SPI0 pins of the slave board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Slave is working....

Succeed!!
