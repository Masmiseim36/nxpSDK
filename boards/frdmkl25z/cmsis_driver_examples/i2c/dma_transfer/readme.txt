Overview
========
CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across a wide 
range of supported microcontroller devices. The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware 
that implements for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces. 
More information and usage methord please refer to http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.

The cmsis_i2c_edma_transfer example shows how to use I2C cmsis driver in DMA way:

In this example , one i2c instance used as I2C master and another i2c instance used as I2C slave .
1. I2C master send data to I2C slave with DMA . (I2C Slave using interrupt to receive the data)
2. I2C master read data from I2C slave with DMA . (I2C Slave using interrupt to send the data)

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-KL25Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example is configured 2 instances I2C , one as I2C master , another as I2C slave.
The connection should be set as following:
- J10-12 , J10-6 connected
- J10-10 , J10-8 connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini/micro USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Unplug the usb cable about 10 second then plug again to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
