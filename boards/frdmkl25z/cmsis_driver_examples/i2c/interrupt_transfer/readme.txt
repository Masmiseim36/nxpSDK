Overview
========
CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across a wide 
range of supported microcontroller devices. The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware 
that implements for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces. 
More information and usage methord please refer to http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.

The cmsis_i2c_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use CMSIS I2C driver in interrupt way:

In this example , one i2c instance used as I2C master and another i2c instance used as I2C slave .
1. I2C master send data to I2C slave in interrupt . (I2C Slave using interrupt to receive the data)
2. I2C master read data from I2C slave in interrupt . (I2C Slave using interrupt to send the data)

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-KL25Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example is configured 2 instances I2C , one as I2C master , another as I2C slave.
The connection should be set as following:
- J10-12 , J10-6 connected
- J10-10 , J10-8 connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
