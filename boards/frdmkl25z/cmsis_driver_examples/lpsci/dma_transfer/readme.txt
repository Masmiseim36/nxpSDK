Overview
========
CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across a wide 
range of supported microcontroller devices. The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware 
that implements for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces. 
More information and usage methord please refer to http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.

The cmsis_uart_edma_transfer example shows how to use uart cmsis  driver with EDMA:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Note: The example echo every 8 characters, so input 8 characters every time.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-KL25Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LPSCI DMA example
Send back received data
Echo every 8 characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you input 8 characters, system will echo it by UART and them would be seen on the terminal.
