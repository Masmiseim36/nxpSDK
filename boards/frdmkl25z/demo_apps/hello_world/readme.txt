Overview
========
The Hello World demo application provides a sanity check for the new SDK build environments and board bring up. The Hello
World demo prints the "Hello World" string to the terminal using the SDK UART drivers. The purpose of this demo is to
show how to use the UART, and to provide a simple project for debugging and further development.
