Overview
========
The Power manager demo application demonstrates the use of power modes in the KSDK. The demo use the notification mechanism
and prints the power mode menu through the debug console, where the user can set the MCU to a specific power mode. The user
can also set the wakeup source by following the debug console prompts. The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate the
implementation of a power mode manager. The callback can be registered to the framework. If a power mode transition happens,
the callback will be called and user can do something.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KL25Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 9600 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When running the demo, the debug console shows the menu to command the MCU to the target power mode.

NOTE: Only input when the demo asks for input. Input entered at any other time might cause the debug console to overflow
and receive the wrong input value.
