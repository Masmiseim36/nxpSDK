Overview
========
The COP Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK cop driver.
In this example, after 10 times of refreshing, a timeout reset is generated.
Please notice that because COP control registers are write-once only, so the 
COP_Init function and the COP_Disable function can be called only once after reset.
In SystemInit() function which is called in startup code, there is an operation to 
disable the watchdog if macro DISABLE_WDOG is defined as 0, and by default if the 
DISABLE_WDOG is not defined, the DISABLE_WDOG is defined as 1. So this example has 
a special project setting that defines the DISABLE_WDOG macro to 0 so the startup 
code will skip the disable COP WDOG operation.

    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
