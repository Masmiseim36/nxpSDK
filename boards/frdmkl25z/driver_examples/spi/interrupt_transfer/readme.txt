Overview
========
The spi_interrupt example shows how to use spi driver with interrupt:

In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance as slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave,
and check if the data slave received is correct.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-KL25Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI one board:
  + Transfer data from instance0 to instance 1 of SPI interface, SPI0 pins are connected with
    SPI1 pins of board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTANCE0        CONNECTS TO         INSTANCE1
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
MOSI       J1 pin 11          MOSI      J2 pin 17
MISO       J1 pin 1           MISO      J2 pin 19
SCK        J1 pin 9           SCK       J2 pin 4
PCS0       J1 pin 7           PCS0      J1 pin 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPI one board interrupt example started!

SPI transfer finished!
