Overview
========
The uart_dma example shows how to use uart driver with DMA:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Note: The example echo every 8 characters, so input 8 characters every time.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-KL25Z board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
The connection should be set as following:
- RX  of USB2COM connected to J2-18
- TX  of USB2COM connected to J2-20
- GND of USB2COM connected to J2-14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the PC host and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the UART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
