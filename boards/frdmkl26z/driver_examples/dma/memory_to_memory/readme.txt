Overview
========
The DMA memory to memory example is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK software.
It excuates one shot transfer from source buffer to destination buffer using the SDK DMA drivers.
The purpose of this example is to show how to use the DMA and to provide a simple example for
debugging and further development.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KL26Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DMA memory to memory transfer example begin.

Destination Buffer:
0       0       0       0

DMA memory to memory transfer example finish.

Destination Buffer:
1       2       3       4
