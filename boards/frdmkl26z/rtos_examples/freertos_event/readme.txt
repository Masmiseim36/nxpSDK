Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_event example. It shows how task waits for an event (defined set
of bits in event group). This event can be set by any other process or interrupt in the system.

The example application creates three tasks. Two write tasks write_task_1 and write_task_2
continuously setting event bit 0 and bit 1.

Read_task is waiting for any event bit and printing actual state on console. Event bits are
automatically cleared after read task is entered.

Three possible states can occurre:
Both bits are set.z
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KL26Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This Example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.
Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start Tera Term
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start Tera Term
2. New connection -> Serial
3. Set appropriate COMx port (x is port number) in Port context menu. Number is provided by operation
   system and could be different from computer to computer. Select COM number related to virtual
   serial port. Confirm selected port by OK button.
4. Set following connection parameters in menu Setup->Serial port...
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: none
5.  Confirm selected parameters by OK button.


Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will start printing the state of event bits.

Example output:
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.
