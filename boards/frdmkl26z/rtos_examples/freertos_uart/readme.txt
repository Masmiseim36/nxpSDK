Overview
========
The UART example for FreeRTOS demonstrates the possibility to use the UART driver in the RTOS.
The example uses single instance of UART IP and writes string into, then reads back chars.
After every 4B received, these are sent back on UART.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-KL26Z board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J2-18
- TX of USB2COM to J2-20
- GND of USB2COM to J2-14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the PC host and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
You will see the welcome string printed out on the console.
You can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console in a group of 4 characters.
