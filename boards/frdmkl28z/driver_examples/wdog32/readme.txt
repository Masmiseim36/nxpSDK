Overview
========
The WDOG32 Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK wdog32 driver.
In this example, fast testing is first implemented to test the wdog32.
After this, refreshing the watchdog in None-window mode and window mode is executed.
Note wdog32 is disabled in SystemInit function which means wdog32 is disabled
after chip emerges from reset.


Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, will get the similar messages on the OpenSDA terminal.

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-KL28Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This WDOG32 Example project does not call for any special hardware configurations. Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development
board's jumper settings and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.26
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1
