Overview
========
The ADC16 continuous DMA demo application demonstrates the usage of the ADC and DMA peripheral while in a continuous mode. The
ADC16 is first set to continuous mode. In continuous convert configuration, only the initial rising-edge to launch continuous conversions is
observed, and until conversion is aborted, the ADC16 continues to do conversions on the same SCn register that initiated the conversion. 
DMA request will be asserted during an ADC16 conversion complete event noted when any of the SC1n[COCO] flags is asserted. DMA will transfer
ADC16 results to memory and if users press any key, demo will average ADC16 results stored in memory and print average on the terminal.  

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-KL46Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Connect external signal source to user-defined channel, defined by "DEMO_ADC16_CHANNEL" in source code.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
