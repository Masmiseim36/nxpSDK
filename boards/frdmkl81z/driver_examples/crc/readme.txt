Overview
========
The CRC Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to generate checksums
for an ASCII string. Several CRC protocols are implemented using the CRC driver API.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CRC Peripheral Driver Example

Test string: 123456789
CRC-16 CCIT FALSE: 0x29b1
CRC-16 MAXIM: 0x44c2
CRC-16 KERMIT: 0x2189
CRC-32: 0xcbf43926
CRC-32 POSIX: 0x765e7680

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KL81Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.
