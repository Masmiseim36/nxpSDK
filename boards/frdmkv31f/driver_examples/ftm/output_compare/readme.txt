Overview
========
The FTM project is a demonstration program of the SDK FTM driver's output compare feature.
It sets up one FTM channel to toggle the output when a match occurs with the channel value. The user
should probe the FTM output with a oscilloscope to see the signal toggling.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KV31F board
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FTM example for output compare

You will see the output signal toggle
Probe the signal using an oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can use oscilloscope to measure FTM out (Pin out: FTM0 channel 1 - TP14)
 At this example you will see RGD led toggle.
