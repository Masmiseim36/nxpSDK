Overview
========
The flexcan_loopback_functional example shows how to use the loopback test mode to debug your CAN Bus design:

To demonstrates this example, only one board is needed. The example will config one FlexCAN Message
Buffer to Rx Message Buffer and the other FlexCAN Message Buffer to Tx Message Buffer with same ID.
After that, the example will send a CAN Message from the Tx Message Buffer to the Rx Message Buffer
throuth internal loopback interconnect and print out the Message payload to terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.1
- Keil MDK 5.23
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KW36 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the OpenSDA terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
==FlexCAN loopback functional example -- Start.==

Send message from MB9 to MB8
tx word0 = 0x0
tx word1 = 0x1
tx word2 = 0x2
tx word3 = 0x3

Received message from MB8
rx word0 = 0x0
rx word1 = 0x1
rx word2 = 0x2
rx word3 = 0x3
