Overview
========
The flexcan_loopback example shows how to use the loopback test mode to debug your CAN Bus design:

To demonstrates this example, only one board is needed. The example will config one FlexCAN Message
Buffer to Rx Message Buffer and the other FlexCAN Message Buffer to Tx Message Buffer with same ID.
After that, the example will send a CAN Message from the Tx Message Buffer to the Rx Message Buffer
through internal loopback interconnect and print out the Message payload to terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.1
- Keil MDK 5.23
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KW36 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
