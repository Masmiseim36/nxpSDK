Overview
========
The TPM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver to use TPM as a timer.
It sets up the TPM hardware block to trigger an interrupt every 1 millisecond.
When the TPM interrupt is triggered a message a printed on the UART terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.1
- Keil MDK 5.23
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KW36 board
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
This MPU Example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TPM example to simulate a timer

You will see a "-" or "|" in terminal every 1 milisecond:
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
