Overview
========
The TPM project is a demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver's dual-edge capture feature.
This feature is available only on certain SoC's.
The example sets up a TPM channel-pair for dual-edge capture. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print the capture values and period of the input signal on the terminal window.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.4
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KW38 board
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
Connect J4 2-3

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see information from the terminal as below.
SW2 is used as a source signal for this example on FRDM-KW38.
