Overview
========
This project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software for encryption/decryption sample data using EDMA for
AES-CBC algorithm.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KW41Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, from the terminal you can see:

Testing input string:
          Once upon a midnight dreary,
           while I pondered weak and weary,
          Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
          While I nodded,
           nearly napping,
           suddenly there came a tapping,
          As of some one gently rapping,
           rapping at my chamber doorIts some visitor,
           I muttered,
           tapping at my chamber doorOnly this,
           and nothing more.
