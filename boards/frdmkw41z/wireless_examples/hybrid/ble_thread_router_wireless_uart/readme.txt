Overview
========
This application represents the "Kinetis Ble Thread hybrid router eligible device" of the Kinetis Connectivity Demo Applications.
The application for BLE implements a custom GATT based Wireless UART Profile that emulates UART over BLE for the Thread Shell.
A Router Eligible Device is a node which initially joins the network as an End Device, but can adaptively 
become a mesh Router. Such a device may also have capabilities to initialize, create, and bootstrap 
a new Thread Network for the user or a management entity.
For more information please refer to the "Kinetis Thread Stack Demo Applications User's Guide.pdf" document.
