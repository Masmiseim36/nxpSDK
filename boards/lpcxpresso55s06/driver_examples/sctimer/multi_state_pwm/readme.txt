Overview
========
The SCTImer multi-state project is a demonstration program of the SCTimer state machine. It shows how to set up events to be triggered in a certain state
and transitioning between states.
State 0 has 2 events that generate a PWM signal, it also has an event linked to an input signal to transition to State 1.
State 1 has 4 events that generate 2 PWM signals, it also has an event linked to an input signal to transition to State 0.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.10.2
- Keil MDK  5.34
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.4.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55S06 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The switch for this examples is SW4 on the board (PIO0_5)

```
Output signal		Board location
SCT0_OUT2    		J12-12
SCT0_OUT4    		J9-12 
```

# Prepare the Demo

1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the SCTimer multi-state demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCTimer example to output edge-aligned PWM signal

When user presses a switch the PWM signal will be seen from Out 2
When user presses the switch again PWM signal on Out 2 will turn off
The PWM signal from Out 4 will remain active all the time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll see  PWM signals on J12_12 and J9_12 using an oscilloscope
