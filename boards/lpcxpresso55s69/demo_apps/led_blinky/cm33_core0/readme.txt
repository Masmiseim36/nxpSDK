Overview
========
The LED Blinky demo application provides a sanity check for the new SDK build environments and board bring up. The LED Blinky demo 
uses the systick interrupt to realize the function of timing delay. The example takes turns to shine the LED. The purpose of this 
demo is to provide a simple project for debugging and further development.
The code of this demo has been prepared and updated for use with the MCUXpresso Configuration Tools (Pins/Clocks/Peripherals).

- Keil MDK  5.31
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings

No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (P6) on the board
2. Download the program to the target board.
3. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
