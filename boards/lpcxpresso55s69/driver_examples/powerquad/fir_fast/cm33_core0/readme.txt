Overview
========
The PowerQuad fetches data from system RAM and private RAM through different
path, for the calcutations which need data from two parts of memory, such as
FIR, convolve, correlate, and some matrix operations, place the input data B
in private RAM improves the performance.
PowerQuad private RAM starts from address 0xe0000000, the first 4KByte is used
by PowerQuad driver, the RAM starts from 0xe0001000 could be used by user
for optimization. In this example, the FIR taps, convolve input data B, and correlate
input data B are not changed, so they are converted to float format and saved
to private RAM at the beginning.
If the example runs successfully, the performance using optimized method is better
than the nornal method.

- Keil MDK  5.31
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (P6) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The message about error or success will be output to the termial.
