Overview
========
This SCTIMer project is a demonstration program of the SDK SCTimer driver's PWM generation. It sets up a PWM signal
and periodically updates the PWM signals dutycycle.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.5
- Keil MDK  5.31
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer

# Prepare the Demo
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (P6) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the SCTimer driver PWM demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCTimer example to output center-aligned PWM signal
You will see a change in LED brightness if an LED is connected to the SCTimer output pin
If no LED is connected to the pin, then probe the signal using an oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll see  PWM signals with changing duty cycle on P18_11 using an oscilloscope.
