Overview
========
The uart_polling example shows how to use uart driver in polling way:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will send back all characters that PC
send to the board.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.5
- Keil MDK  5.31
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (P6) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
