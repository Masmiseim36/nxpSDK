Overview
========
The SAI Demo application demonstrates complicated digital audio playback and record case. The demo provide these features below:
1. Duplex audio transfer, record and playback at same time.
2. Playback a 250 Hz sine wave data generated by CMSIS-DSP library. Also compute the fundamental frequency using Fast Fourier Transform with CMSIS-DSP library.
3. Record a 5 seconds audio to sdcard with a FatFs system. After record, playback it. This feature may only existed in platform which support sdhc.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Min/micro USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The sai_edma example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial 
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 related jumpers connected

The sai_edma example needs to connect to WM8960 codec, in MAPS-KS22F256 board(Yellow board), the jumper settings should
be:
- JP5 : 2-3
- JP6 : 2-3
- JP7 : 2-3
- JP8 : 2-3
- JP13 Connected
- JP14 Connected

On MAPS-DOCK boards:
- JP1 all on

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Insert the headphones into the headphone jack. 
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, you can hear the tone and the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SAI example started!
