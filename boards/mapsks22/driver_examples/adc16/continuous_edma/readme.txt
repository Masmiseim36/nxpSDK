Overview
========
The ADC16 continuous EDMA demo application demonstrates the usage of the ADC and EDMA peripheral while in a continuous mode. The
ADC16 is first set to continuous mode. In continuous convert configuration, only the initial rising-edge to launch continuous conversions is
observed, and until conversion is aborted, the ADC16 continues to do conversions on the same SCn register that initiated the conversion. 
EDMA request will be asserted during an ADC16 conversion complete event noted when any of the SC1n[COCO] flags is asserted. EDMA will transfer
ADC16 results to memory and if users press any key, demo will average ADC16 results stored in memory and print average on the terminal.  

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The adc16_polling_example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 related jumpers connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
