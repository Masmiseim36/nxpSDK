Overview
========

The adc16_polling example shows the simplest way to use ADC16 driver.

In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the ADC16's
sample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution 
would check the conversion completed flag in loop until the flag is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. 
Then read the conversion result value and print it to debug console.

Note, the default setting of initialization for the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can change
the configuration structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.

The auto-calibration is not essential but strongly recommended. It can help to adjust the converter itself and improve
the ADC16's performance.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The adc16_polling_example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 related jumpers connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
