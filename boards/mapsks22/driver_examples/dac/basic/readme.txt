Overview
========

The dac_basic example shows how to use DAC module simply as the general DAC converter.

When the DAC's buffer feature is not enabled, the first item of the buffer is used as the DAC output data register.
The converter would always output the value of the first item. In this example, it gets the value from terminal,
outputs the DAC output voltage through DAC output pin.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The dac_basic_example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 related jumpers connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DAC basic Example.
Please input a value (0 - 4095) to output with DAC: 200
Input value is 200
DAC out: 200
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then user can measure the DAC output pin to check responding voltage.
Customization options
