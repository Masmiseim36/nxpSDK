Overview
========
The flexcan_interrupt example shows how to use FlexCAN driver in none-blocking interrupt way:

In this example, 2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message to
Endpoint B(board B) when user press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receive the message, print
the message content to terminal and echo back the message. Endpoint A will increase the received
message and waiting for the next transmission of the user initiated.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The flexcan_interrupt example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 related jumpers connected

To enable flexcan communication on two boards, connect same port on each board, that is:
- Board1_CN7_Port1 <--> Board2_CN7_Port1
- Board1_CN7_Port2 <--> Board2_CN7_Port2

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
After connecting the two boards, these instructions display on each terminal window.
One board must be chosen as node A and the other board as node B. (Note: Node B should start first)
Data is sent continuously between the node A and the node B.

This message displays on the node A terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

********* FLEXCAN Interrupt EXAMPLE *********
