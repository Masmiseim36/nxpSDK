Overview
========
The pee_bpli example shows how to use MCG driver to change from PEE mode to BLPI mode:

 1. How to use the mode functions for MCG mode switch.
 2. How to use the frequency functions to get current MCG frequency.
 3. Work flow
    Boot to PEE mode from default reset mode
    Change mode PEE -> PBE ->FBE -> FBI -> BLPI
    Change back BLPI -> FBI -> FBE -> PBE -> PEE
    Get System clock in PEE mode to blink LED

In this example, because the debug console's clock frequency may change,
so the example running information is not output from debug console. Here the
LED blinks to show that the example finished successfully.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The mcg_pee_blpi example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 related jumpers connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the board's LED RED2 will blink.
