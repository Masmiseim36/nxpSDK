Overview
========

The pdb_adc16_trigger example shows how to use the PDB to generate a ADC trigger.

Based on the basic counter, to use the ADC trigger, just to enable the ADC trigger's "milestone" and set the user-
defined value for it.
After the PDB counter is triggered to start, when the counter pass the "milestone", the ADC's Pre-Trigger would be
generated and sent to the ADC module.

In this example, the ADC16 is configured with hardware trigger and conversion complete interrupt enabled.
Once it gets the trigger from the PDB, the conversion goes, then the ISR would be executed.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The pdb_adc16_trigger example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 related jumpers connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
