Overview
========
The DPU Fetch Decode example shows how to use the DPU driver to enable fetch decoder
unit and the scaler. The fetch decoder output frame size is smaller than desired
output, so the scaler units are used for the frame size convert.

In this example, the screen is divided to two parts, one for content stream, and
the other for safty stream.

If this example runs success, rectangles will move in the screen.

The DPU path is configured like this:

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK CPU Board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- MX8_DSI_OLED1 board
- Personal Computer

Another option is using monitor but not OLED panel, in this case MX8_DSI_OLED1 board
is not required, LVDS or MIPI_DSI could be used. To use LVDS, these are required:
- X-IMX-LVDS-HDMI convert board
- Monitor supports HDMI input
To use MIPI_DSI, these are required:
- X-IMX-MIPI-HDMI convert board
- Monitor supports HDMI input

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Use X-IMX-VAL-SAS cable to connect J9 and MX8_DSI_OLED1 board.
3.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
4.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
5.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
6.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

If use monitor to display through MIPI_DSI, change step 2 to:
    Use X-IMX-VAL-SAS cable to connect J9 and X-IMX-MIPI-HDMI board, and connect
    the X-IMX-MIPI-HDMI convert board with the monitor. Then change
    #define APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR 0
    to
    #define APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR 1
    in dpu_example.h.

If use monitor to display through LVDS, change step 2 to:
    Use X-IMX-VAL-SAS cable to connect J7 and X-IMX-LVDS-HDMI board, and connect
    the X-IMX-LVDS-HDMI convert board with the monitor. Then change
    #define APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR 0
    to
    #define APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR 1
    and change
    #define DPU_EXAMPLE_DI DPU_DI_MIPI
    to
    #define DPU_EXAMPLE_DI DPU_DI_LVDS
    in dpu_example.h.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see screen output described in overview.

NOTE: Before load and run the project, press SW1 until D3/D5 are off, then press
SW1 until D3/D5 are on. This perform a whole reset.
