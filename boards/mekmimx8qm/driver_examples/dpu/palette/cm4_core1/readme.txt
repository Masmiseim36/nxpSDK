Overview
========
This example shows how to use the palette feature of fetch layer and fetch decoder.

The right part is fetch decoder output. The palette is set to blue color varies
from 255 to 0. So the output is blue color with different degrees.

The left part is fetch layer output. In this project, the 8 sublayers are all
enabled, the sublayer 0 output is at the top, and the sublayer 7 output is at
the bottom. All sublayers use the same input framebuffer but use the
different color palettes, so the sublayer output colors are different.
The fetch layer palette entries are divided into 8 groups, one for each sublayer.
Every group has 32 entries, the valid index width is 5. So even though the index
in frame buffer is 8-bit width, only the 5-LSB are used for the palette index.

The DPU path is configured like this:

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK CPU Board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- MX8_DSI_OLED1 board
- Personal Computer

Another option is using monitor but not OLED panel, in this case MX8_DSI_OLED1 board
is not required, LVDS or MIPI_DSI could be used. To use LVDS, these are required:
- X-IMX-LVDS-HDMI convert board
- Monitor supports HDMI input
To use MIPI_DSI, these are required:
- X-IMX-MIPI-HDMI convert board
- Monitor supports HDMI input

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Use X-IMX-VAL-SAS cable to connect J9 and MX8_DSI_OLED1 board.
3.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
4.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
5.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
6.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

If use monitor to display through MIPI_DSI, change step 2 to:
    Use X-IMX-VAL-SAS cable to connect J9 and X-IMX-MIPI-HDMI board, and connect
    the X-IMX-MIPI-HDMI convert board with the monitor. Then change
    #define APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR 0
    to
    #define APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR 1
    in dpu_example.h.

If use monitor to display through LVDS, change step 2 to:
    Use X-IMX-VAL-SAS cable to connect J7 and X-IMX-LVDS-HDMI board, and connect
    the X-IMX-LVDS-HDMI convert board with the monitor. Then change
    #define APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR 0
    to
    #define APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR 1
    and change
    #define DPU_EXAMPLE_DI DPU_DI_MIPI
    to
    #define DPU_EXAMPLE_DI DPU_DI_LVDS
    in dpu_example.h.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see screen output described in overview.

NOTE: Before load and run the project, press SW1 until D3/D5 are off, then press
SW1 until D3/D5 are on. This perform a whole reset.
