Overview
========

The lpadc_single_polling example shows the simplest way to use LPADC driver.

In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC's
sample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution 
would check the FIFO valid flag in loop until the flag is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. 
Then read the conversion result value and print it to debug console.

Note, the default setting of initialization for the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can change
the configuration structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK Board
- MCIMX8-8X-BB
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
- Input voltage signal(0~1.8V) to TP77(LPADC0 CH0, on base board)

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
