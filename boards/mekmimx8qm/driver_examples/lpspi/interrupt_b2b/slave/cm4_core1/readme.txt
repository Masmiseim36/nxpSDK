Overview
========
The lpspi_interrupt_b2b example shows how to use LPSPI driver in interrupt way:

In this example , we need two boards , one board used as LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.
The file 'dspi_interrupt_b2b_slave.c' includes the LPSPI slave code.
This example does not use the transactional API in LPSPI driver. It's a demonstration that how to use the interrupt in KSDK driver.

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the data)

Board settings
==============
SPI two boards:
Transfer data from one board's instance to another board's instance.
SPI2 pins are connected with SPI2 pins of another board

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
