Overview
========

The lwip_mqtt demo application demonstrates MQTT client connecting to MQTT broker via unsecured socket.
The application obtains IP and DNS addresses from DHCP and resolves broker's hostname if needed.
Then it connects to the broker and subscribes to the "lwip_topic/#" and "lwip_other/#" topics.
Further it publishes five messages to the "lwip_topic/100" which are also received back
as the board is subscribed to the "lwip_topic/#".
Meanwhile it continues to receive messages published to the subscribed topics from other clients.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK Board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Network cable RJ45 standard
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special setting needed.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Insert Cable to Ethernet RJ45 port and connect it to a router (or other DHCP server capable device).
5.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
6.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.
Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
