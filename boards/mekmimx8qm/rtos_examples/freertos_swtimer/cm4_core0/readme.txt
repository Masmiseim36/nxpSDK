Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_swtimer example. It shows usage of software timer and its
callback.

The example application creates one software timer SwTimer. The timer’s callback SwTimerCallback is
periodically executed and text “Tick.” is printed to terminal.




Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK CPU Board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.
