Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_tickless example. It shows how the CPU enters the sleep mode and then
it is woken up either by expired time delay using low power timer module or by external interrupt caused by a
user defined button.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK CPU Board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Note: Since there's no available switch on the board, pressing Switch to wake up the CPU 
      is not realized in this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
