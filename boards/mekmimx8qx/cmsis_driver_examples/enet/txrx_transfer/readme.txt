Overview
========

The enet_rxtx example shows the simplest way to use ENET driver for simple 
frame receive and transmit.

1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET MAC.
2. How to use ENET MAC to receive and transmit frame.

The example transmits 20 number broadcast frame, print the frame length, source MAC address
and destination MAC address when receive frame.

Note, The RGMII mode is used for default setting to initialize the ENET interface between MAC and the external PHY. you
can change it to RMII mode as you wish. Please make sure the RMII Mode setting in the MAC is synchronize to the setting
for the external PHY.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8QX MEK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Loopback network cable RJ45 standard
- Network cable RJ45 standard
- Network switch
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
J7 connected with network switch through RJ45 network cable.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J11 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Insert loopback network cable into network switch device(support loopback frames) and connect switch to board's Ethernet RJ45 port.
5.  Download the program to the target board.
6.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Make loopback network cable:
      Standard 1	     Standard 2
J1    orange+white       green+white
J2    orange             green
J3    green+white        orange+white
J4    blue               brown+white
J5    blue+white         brown
J6    green              orange
J7	  brown+white        blue
J8    brown              blue+white

Connect J1 => J3, J2 => J6, J4 => J7, J5 => J8. 10/100M transfer only requires J1, J2, J3, J6, and 1G transfer requires all 8 pins.
Check your net cable color order and refer to the sheet above. If your cable's color order is not showed in the list,
please connect J1~J8 based on your situation.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the debug terminal like:

ENET example start.
The 1 frame transmitted success!
A total of 1 frame(s) has been successfully received!
The 2 frame transmitted success!
A total of 2 frame(s) has been successfully received!
The 3 frame transmitted success!
A total of 3 frame(s) has been successfully received!

......

The 20 frame transmitted success!
A total of 20 frame(s) has been successfully received!
