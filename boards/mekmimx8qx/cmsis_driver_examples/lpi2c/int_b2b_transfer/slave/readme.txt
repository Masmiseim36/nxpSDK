Overview
========
CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across a wide 
range of supported microcontroller devices. The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware 
that implements for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces. 
More information and usage method please refer to http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.

The lpi2c_int_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use CMSIS i2c driver as master to do board to board transfer 
with interrupt:

In this example, one lpi2c instance as master and another lpi2c instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

Board settings
==============
LPI2C board to board example:
  + Transfer data from MASTER_BOARD to SLAVE_BOARD of LPI2C interface, LPI2C pins of MASTER_BOARD are connected with
    LPI2C pins of SLAVE_BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER_BOARD        CONNECTS TO         SLAVE_BOARD
Pin Name     Board Location     Pin Name     Board Location
LPI2C_SCL    J7-1               LPI2C_SCL    J7-1
LPI2C_SDA    J7-3               LPI2C_SDA    J7-3
GND          J7-2               GND          J7-2

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW3 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J11 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

SLAVE_BOARD will displayed:
