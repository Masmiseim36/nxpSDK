Overview
========
The FTM project is a demonstration program of generating a combined PWM signal by the SDK FTM driver. It sets up the FTM
hardware block to output PWM signals on two TPM channels. The example also shows the complementary mode of operation
and deadtime insertion.
On boards that have 2 LEDs connected to the FTM pins, the user will see a change in LED brightness.
And if the board do not support LEDs to show, the outputs can be observed by oscilloscope.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8QX MEK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
Use oscilloscope to probe the signal on U33-5,U33-4 (On base board).

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW3 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J11 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FTM example to output combined complementary PWM signals on two channels

You will see a change in LED brightness if an LED is connected to the FTM pin

If no LED is connected to the FTM pin, then probe the signal using an oscilloscope
