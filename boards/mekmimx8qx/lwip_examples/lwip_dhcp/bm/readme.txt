Overview
========

The lwip_dhcp demo application demonstrates a DHCP demo on the lwIP TCP/IP stack.
The application acts as a DHCP client and prints the status as it is progressing.
Once the interface is being bound to an IP address obtained from DHCP server, address information is printed.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8QX MEK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Network cable RJ45 standard
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special setting needed.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW3 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J11 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Insert Cable to Ethernet RJ45 port and connect it to a router (or other DHCP server capable device).
5.  Download the program to the target board.
6.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
