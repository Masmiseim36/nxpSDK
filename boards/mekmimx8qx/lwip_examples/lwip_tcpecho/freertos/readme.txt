Overview
========

The lwip_tcpecho demo application demonstrates a TCP echo demo on the lwIP TCP/IP stack with bare metal KSDK or
FreeRTOS. The demo uses the TCP protocol and acts as an echo server. The application sends back the received TCP
packets from the PC, which can be used to test whether a TCP connection is available.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8QX MEK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Network cable RJ45 standard
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special setting needed.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW3 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J11 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Insert the Ethernet Cable into the target board's RJ45 port and connect it to your PC network adapter.
5.  Download the program to the target board.
6.  Configure the host PC IP address to 192.168.0.100.
7.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
1. When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
        ************************************************
         TCP Echo example
        ************************************************
         IPv4 Address     : 192.168.0.102
         IPv4 Subnet mask : 255.255.255.0
         IPv4 Gateway     : 192.168.0.100
        ************************************************
2. From the command window, type echotool 192.168.0.102 /p tcp /r 7 /d hello
    NOTE: The echotool.exe application can be found here https://github.com/PavelBansky/EchoTool
3. The command window should get response:
        Hostname 192.168.0.102 resolved as 192.168.0.102
