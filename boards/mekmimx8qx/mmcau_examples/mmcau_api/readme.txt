Overview
========
Memory-Mapped Cryptographic Acceleration Unit (MMCAU)

This project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software for encryption/decryption sample
data using AES-CBC, DES3-CBC and Hash algorithms MD5, SHA1 and SHA256.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8QX MEK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW3 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J11 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

          Once upon a midnight dreary,
           while I pondered weak and weary,
          Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
          While I nodded,
           nearly napping,
           suddenly there came a tapping,
          As of some one gently rapping,
           rapping at my chamber doorIts some visitor,
           I muttered,
           tapping at my chamber doorOnly this,
           and nothing more.
