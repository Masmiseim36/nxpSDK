Overview
========
This document explains the freertos_event example. It shows how task waits for an event (defined set
of bits in event group). This event can be set by any other process or interrupt in the system.

The example application creates three tasks. Two write tasks write_task_1 and write_task_2
continuously setting event bit 0 and bit 1.

Read_task is waiting for any event bit and printing actual state on console. Event bits are
automatically cleared after read task is entered.

Three possible states can occurre:
Both bits are set.z
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8QX MEK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW3 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J11 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.
...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will start printing the state of event bits.

Example output:
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set.
Bit B0 is set.
Bit B1 is set
