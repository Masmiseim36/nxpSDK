Overview
========
Demonstrates the DMIC working with I2S. One or Stereo channel Audio data is converted to samples in the DMIC module.
Then, the data is placed into the memory buffer. Last, it is send to the I2S buffer and sent
to the CODEC, then the audio data will be output to Lineout of CODEC.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.7.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT685-AUD-EVK boards
- Personal Computer
- headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack

Board settings
==============
Connect JP44 1-2,JP45 1-2

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect headphones to J4.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.


Running the demo
================
Note: As the MIMXRT685-AUD-EVK support one on board codec, so you cannot use macro DEMO_DMIC_NUMS to control the counts of the DMIC

This example transfers data from DMIC to Codec. Connect headphone/earphone on audio out of the board.
Speak on DMIC or play song nearby the dmic (U40),  you can hear sound from headphone/earphone.
The log below shows example output of the I2S driver demo in the terminal window:
