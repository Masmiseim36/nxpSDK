Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT685-AUD-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the frequency measure demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Capture source: External clock (clk_in) (main system clock reference), reference frequency = 250105263 Hz
Computed frequency value = 23999301 Hz
Expected frequency value = 24000000 Hz

Capture source: RTC32K oscillator (main clock reference), reference frequency = 250105263 Hz
Computed frequency value = 5001265 Hz
Expected frequency value = 5002105 Hz

Capture source: FRO oscillator (main clock reference), reference frequency = 48000000 Hz
Computed frequency value = 52240185 Hz
Expected frequency value = 48000000 Hz
