Overview
========

The I2S example project uses one I2S interface to continuously record input sound to a buffer
and another I2S interface to playback the buffer to output - digital loopback.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.60.1
- Keil MDK  5.39.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT685-AUD-EVK board
- Personal Computer
- headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack
- source of sound (line output to 3.5 mm stereo jack)


Board settings
==============


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect headphones to J4.
2.  Connect source of sound(from PC or Smart phone) to Audio Line-In connector J55.
3.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
4.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
5.  Download the program to the target board.
6.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
