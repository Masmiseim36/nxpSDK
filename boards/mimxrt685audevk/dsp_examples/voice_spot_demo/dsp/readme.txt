Overview
========
The voice_spot_demo application demonstrates Voice Spot initialization and processing.
It gets the audio data from the on-board microphone, looks for a wake word (Hey NXP) and outputs
the audio data to the speaker.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Xtensa Xplorer  9.0.18
- Xtensa C Compiler  14.01

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- JTAG/SWD debugger
- MIMXRT685-AUD-EVK board
- Personal Computer
- Headphones with 3.5 mm stereo jack

Board settings
==============

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect headphones to Audio HP / Line-Out connector (J4).
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the debug USB port (J5) on the board
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program for CM33 core to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
6.  If building debug configuration, download the program for DSP core to the target board.
7.  If building debug configuration, launch the Xtensa IDE or xt-gdb debugger to
begin running the demo.

NOTE: DSP image can only be debugged using J-Link debugger.  See
'Getting Started with Xplorer for MIMXRT685-AUD-EVK.pdf' for more information.

Running the demo
================
The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.

This example transfers data from DMIC to Codec and waits for the wake word. Connect headphone/earphone on audio out of the board.
Speak into the DMIC or play audio near the DMIC (U40), and you will hear sound on the right channel of
headphone/earphone.
