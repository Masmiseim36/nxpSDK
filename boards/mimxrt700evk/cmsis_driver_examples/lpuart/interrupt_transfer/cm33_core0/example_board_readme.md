Hardware requirements
===================
- Type-C USB cable
- MIMXRT700-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for MCU-Link serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
===============
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the MCU-Link terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
USART CMSIS interrupt example
Board receives 8 characters then sends them out
Now please input:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you input 8 characters, system will echo it by LPUART and them would be seen on the MCU-Link terminal.
