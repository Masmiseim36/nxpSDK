# jpegdec_single_stream_repeat

## Overview
The SD JPEG decoder example decodes a series of JPEG pictures stored on SD card
then shows them one by one on panel.
Only one slot is used with two descriptors linked with each other as ping-pong descriptors.
After one descriptor finishes the other will be loaded.
