# lcdif_porter_duff

## Overview
This example demonstrates how to use the LCDIF alpha blend function to perform the
Porter Duff compositing. In this example, a red rectangle of overlay layer 0 is in
the top left corner of the panel as source surface, and a blue rectangle of the video/graphic
layer is at the bottom right position of the red one as destination surface. Every
Porter Duff mode result is shown for 2 seconds, then switch to the next mode.
