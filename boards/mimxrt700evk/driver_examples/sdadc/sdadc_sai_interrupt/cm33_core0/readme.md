# sdadc_sai_interrupt

## Overview
The sdadc sai interrupt example shows how to use sdadc driver with interrupt.
In this example, sdadc gathers analog data from the microphone, and uses the
sai to send the digital data to the codec. The user can hear the sound from
the microphone and see the log on the terminal.
