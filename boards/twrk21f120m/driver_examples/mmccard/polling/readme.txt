Overview
========
The MMCCARD Polling project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It reads/writes
/erases the MMC card continusly. The purpose of this example is to show how to use MMCCARD driver and
show how to use polling based transfer API in SDK software driver to access MMC card.

Note:
User can use MMC plus card or emmc(on board IC, but not recommand use emmc socket,due to high speed timing restriction)

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.3
- Keil MDK 5.23
- GCC ARM Embedded 6-2017-q2
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso10.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-K21F120M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The MMCCARD Polling example is configured to use SDHC0 with PTE0, PTE1, PTE2, PTE3, PTE4, PTE5 pins
and use PTD10 pin as card detection pin. It doesn't detetet write protect switch state so don't open
the write protect switch on the SD card socket.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the example.

Running the demo
================

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below:

MMCCARD polling example.

Card user partition size xxxx bytes

Working condition:

  Voltage: VCC - xxxx  VCCQ - xxxx

  Timing mode: xxxx

  Bus width: xxxx

  Freq : xxxx HZ

Read/Write the card continuously until encounter error.... 

Write/read one data block......
Compare the read/write content......
The read/write content is consistent.
Write/read multiple data blocks......
Compare the read/write content......
The read/write content is consistent.
Erase data groups......

Input 'q' to quit read/write/erase process.                
Input other char to read/write/erase data blocks again.
