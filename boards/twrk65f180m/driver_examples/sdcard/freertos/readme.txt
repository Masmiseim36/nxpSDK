Overview
========
The SDCARD FreeRTOS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It reads/writes
/erases the SD card continusly. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD driver 
with FreeRTOS in SDK software to access SD card.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.70.1
- Keil MDK 5.20
- GCC ARM Embedded 2015-4.9-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- Atollic TrueSTUDIO 5.5.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-K65F180M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The SDCARD FreeRTOS example is configured to use SDHC0 with PTE0, PTE1, PTE2, PTE3, PTE4, PTE5 pins
and use PTA9 pin as card detection pin.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the OpenSDA terminal:

Please insert a card into board.
Detected SD card inserted.

Read/write/erase the card continuously untile encounters error......

Write/read one data block......
Compare the read/write content......
The read/write content is consistent.
Write/read multiple data blocks......
Compare the read/write content......
The read/write content is consistent.
Erase multiple data blocks......

Input 'q' to quit read/write/erase process.
Input other char to read/write/erase data blocks again.
