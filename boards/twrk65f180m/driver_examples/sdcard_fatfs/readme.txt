Overview
========
The SDCARD FATFS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. Tt mounts a file 
system based on a SD card then does "creat directory/read directory/create file/write file/read file"
operation. The file sdhc_config.h has default SDHC configuration which can be adjusted to let card
driver has different performance. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD driver 
based FATFS disk in SDK software.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.70.1
- Keil MDK 5.20
- GCC ARM Embedded 2015-4.9-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- Atollic TrueSTUDIO 5.5.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-K65F180M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The SDCARD FATFS example is configured to use SDHC0 with PTE0, PTE1, PTE2, PTE3, PTE4, PTE5 pins
and use PTA9 pin as card detection pin.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following prompts can be seen from the OpenSDA terminal:
