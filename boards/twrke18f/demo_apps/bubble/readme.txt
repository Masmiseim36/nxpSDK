Overview
========
The bubble application demonstrates basic usage of the on-board accelerometer to implement a
bubble level. A bubble level utilizes two axes to visually show deviation from a level plane
(0 degrees) on a given access.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- TWR-KE18F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the board is programmed, simply tilt the board to see the LED illuminate. One LED color
indicates X-axis angle while another indicates Y-axis angle.
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

Welcome to the BUBBLE example

You will see angle data change in the console when change the angles of board
x=     23 y =     56
x=      9 y =     53
x=     14 y =     49
