Overview
========
The flexio_spi_slave_interrupt_lpspi_master example shows how to use flexio spi slave driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated slave connect to a lpspi master.



Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- TWR-KE18F board
- Primary Elevator
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires connecting the FLEXIO pins with the LPSPI pins
Insert TWR-KE18F board into Primary Elevator. The connection should be set as following:
- B7-Elevator, B48-Elevator connected
- B9-Elevator, B46-Elevator connected
- B10-Elevator, B44-Elevator connected
- B11-Elevator, B45-Elevator connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LPSPI Master interrupt - FLEXIO SPI Slave interrupt example start.

This example use one lpspi instance as master and one flexio spi slave on one board.

Master and slave are both use interrupt way.

Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:

LPSPI_master -- FLEXIO_SPI_slave

   CLK      --    CLK

   PCS      --    PCS

   SOUT     --    SIN

   SIN      --    SOUT

This is FLEXIO SPI slave call back.

LPSPI master <-> FLEXIO SPI slave transfer all data matched!

End of Example.
