Overview
========
The bubble application demonstrates basic usage of the on-board accelerometer to implement a
bubble level. A bubble level utilizes two axes to visually show deviation from a level plane
(0 degrees) on a given access. .

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- TWR-KL28Z72M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini/micro USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================

indicates X-axis angle while another indicates Y-axis angle.
  When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to the BUBBLE example

You will see angle data change in the console when change the angles of board

x=  6 y = 22
x=  8 y = 26
x= 10 y = 28
x= 10 y = 28
x= 11 y = 29
x= 11 y = 29
