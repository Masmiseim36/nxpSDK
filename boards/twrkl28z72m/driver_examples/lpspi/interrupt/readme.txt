Overview
========
The lpspi_functional_interrupt example shows how to use LPSPI driver in interrupt way:

In this example , one lpspi instance used as LPSPI master and another lpspi instance used as LPSPI slave .

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the data)


Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LPSPI functional interrupt example start.

This example use one lpspi instance as master and another as slave on one board.

Master uses interrupt way and slave uses interrupt way.

Note that some LPSPI instances interrupt is in INTMUX ,you should set the intmux when you porting this example accordingly

Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:

LPSPI_master -- LPSPI_slave

   CLK      --    CLK

   PCS      --    PCS

   SOUT     --    SIN

   SIN      --    SOUT

LPSPI transfer all data matched!

End of example.

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- TWR-KL28Z72M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To make the example work, connections needed to be as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       MASTER           connect to      SLAVE
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
SOUT       Elevator(A78)        SIN       Elevator(B11)
SIN        Elevator(A77)        SOUT      Elevator(B10)
SCK        Elevator(A79)        SCK       Elevator(B7)
PCS0       Elevator(A80)        PCS0      Elevator(B9)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.
