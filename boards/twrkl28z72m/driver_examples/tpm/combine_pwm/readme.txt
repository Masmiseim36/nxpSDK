Overview
========
The TPM project is a demonstration program of generating a combined PWM signal by the SDK TPM driver. It sets up the TPM
hardware block to output PWM signals on two TPM channels. The example also show's the complementary mode of operation
and deadtime insertion.
On boards that have 2 LEDs connected to the TPM pins, the user will see
a change in LED brightness if user enter different values.
And if the board do not support LEDs to show, the outputs can be observed by oscilloscope.
Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-KL28Z72M board
- Personal Computer
- Primary Elevator board
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.
 Connect A79-Elevator to J20-1 and A80-Elevator to J22-1
 Or connect A79-Elevator and A80-Elevator to Oscilloscope

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see information from the terminal as below.

TPM example to output combined complementary PWM signals on two channels

If an LED is connected to the TPM pin, you will see a change in LED brightness if you enter different values
If no LED is connected to the TPM pin, then probe the signal using an oscilloscope
Please enter a value to update the Duty cycle:
Note: The range of value is 1 to 9.
For example: If enter '5', the duty cycle will be set to 50 percent.
Value:5
The duty cycle was successfully updated!
