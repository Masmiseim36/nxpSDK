Overview
========
The TPM project is a demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver's input capture feature.
The example sets up a TPM channel for dual-edge capture. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print the capture value.
Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-KL28Z72M board
- Personal Computer
- Primary Elevator board

Board settings
==============
- Connect input signal to A40-Elevator

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see information from the terminal as below.
