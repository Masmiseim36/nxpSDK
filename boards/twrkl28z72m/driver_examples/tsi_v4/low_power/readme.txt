Overview
========
The tsi_v4_low_power example shows how to use TSI_V4 driver in low power modes:

In this example , we make use of the available electrodes on board to show driver usage.
1. Firstly, we get the non-touch calibration results as baseline electrode counter;
2. Then, we start the Hardware-Trigger scan using interrupt method to wakeup from low power
   modes through pad touch;
3. Note: you can select which low power mode you want to enter into.

Running the demo
================
1. Download the code to device flash, do not using debug mode.
2. Power-off then power-on the board.
3. Open serial terminal utility with specific COM number, then press "Reset Button" on board.
4. Do as the message shown in terminal guides.

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

Note: The message shown below will different depends on your input character.

Let's move to the low power modes world!!!

Press specific key to enter stop mode.
After enter stop modes, touch PAD D5 to wakeup.

Please input the mode you want to enter!
0 ------>  STOP MODE
1 ------>  VLPS MODE
2 ------>  LLS  MODE
3 ------>  VLLS1 MODE
4 ------>  VLLS2 MODE
5 ------>  VLLS3 MODE
