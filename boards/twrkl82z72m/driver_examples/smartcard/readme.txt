Overview
========
This example demonstrates the SDK Peripheral drivers working with different methods.

This example demonstrates use of smartcard driver API to read GSM sim card ICC-ID (Integrated circuit card identifier,
which should be placed on the card). 
Please be aware, that this example is just simple demonstration of smartcard driver API. It may not work with all types
of GSM sim cards.

Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start Tera Term
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start Tera Term
2. New connection -> Serial
3. Set appropriate COMx port (x is port number) in Port context menu. Number is provided by operation
   system and could be different from computer to computer. Select COM number related to virtual
   serial port. Confirm selected port by OK button.
4. Set following connection parameters in menu Setup->Serial port...
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: one
5.  Confirm selected parameters by OK button.

Running the demo
