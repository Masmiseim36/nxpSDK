Overview
========
The SLCD number guess demo application demonstrates the use of the SLCD peripheral and driver.

The SLCD number guess demo has two demo displays:

1. The first demo is a basic SLCD test, where all numbers and icons are shown one by one on the screen.

2. The second demo is the "Number Guess" game. This demo asks the user to input a number. The demo then provides
clues to the user to help the user guess the correct number.

"Great, xxx you has GOT it!" will be shown on the console, and the victory will be displayed on the LCD screen when the
user successfully guesses the correct number.

1. Basic Testing
The demo performs basic testing on the SLCD first. All numbers and icons are displayed, one-by-one, on the screen.

2. Guess the number game

Next, the demo asks the user to play a number guessing game.

The user can input a number (0-9999) in the console and the number is displayed on the SLCD screen.
In the example below, if the number is 6396, it took the user four guesses before choosing the correct number.
