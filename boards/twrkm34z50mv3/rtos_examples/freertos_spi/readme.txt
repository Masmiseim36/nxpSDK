Overview
========
The freertos_spi example shows how to use SPI driver in FreeRTOS:

In this example , one spi instance is used as SPI master with blocking and another spi instance is used as SPI slave.

1. SPI master sends/receives data using task blocking calls to/from SPI slave. (SPI Slave uses interrupt to receive/send
the data)


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- TWR-KM34Z50MV3 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI one board:
  + Transfer data loopback with SPI0 module, only connect MOSI pin to MISO pin of SPI0 on board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTANCE0   
Pin Name   Primary                Pin Name    Primary
MOSI       B10           <==>     MISO        B11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPI FreeRTOS example start.
This example use one SPI instance in master mode
to transfer data through loopback.
Please be sure to externally connect together SOUT and SIN signals.
   SOUT     --    SIN
SPI transfer completed successfully.
Data verified ok.
