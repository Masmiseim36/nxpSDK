Overview
========
The lpuart_interrupt Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver.
In the example, you can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console
 in a group of 8 characters.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- TWR-KM34Z75M board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J14-1
- TX of USB2COM to J16-1
- GND of USB2COM to J25-10

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the host PC and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the log would be seen on the UART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lpuart interrupt example
Board receives 8 characters then sends them out
Now please input:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you input 8 characters, system will echo it by LPUART and them would be seen on the terminal.
