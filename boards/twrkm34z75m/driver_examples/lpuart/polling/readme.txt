Overview
========
The lpuart_polling Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver.
In the example, you can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console
 instantly.
Note: Please input one character at a time. If you input too many characters each time, the receiver may overflow
because the LPUART uses simple polling way for receiving.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro/Mini USB cable
- TWR-KM34Z75M board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J14-1
- TX of USB2COM to J16-1
- GND of USB2COM to J25-10

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the host PC and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the log would be seen on the UART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
