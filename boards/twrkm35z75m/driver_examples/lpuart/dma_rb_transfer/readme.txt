Overview
========
The lpuart_dma Ring Buffer Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver.
In the example, a ring buffer will be used with DMA enabled, data received will be stored in ring 
buffer first, while IDLE line was detected, routine will read out the received characters, and echo back
them to the terminal by using DMA mode. so, you can see the your pressed characters on the terminal.

And the ring buffer is achieved based on the DMA's source address modulo feature, the base address
should be aligned to a 0-modulo-boundary.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.10.2
- Keil MDK  5.34
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.4.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- TWR-KM35Z75M board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J14-1
- TX of USB2COM to J16-1
- GND of USB2COM to J25-10

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the host PC and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the log would be seen on the UART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
