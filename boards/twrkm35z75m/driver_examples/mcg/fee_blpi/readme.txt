Overview
========
The fee_bpli example shows how to use MCG driver to change from FEE mode to BLPI mode:

 1. How to use the mode functions for MCG mode switch.
 2. How to use the frequency functions to get current MCG frequency.
 3. Work flow
    Boot to FEE mode from default reset mode
    Change from FEE -> FBI -> BLPI
    Change back BLPI -> FBI -> FEE
    Get System clock in FEE mode to blink LED

In this example, because the debug console's clock frequency may change,
so the example running information is not output from debug console. Here the
LED blinks to show that the example finished successfully.
