Overview
========

The CMP polling Example shows the simplest way to use CMP driver and help user with a quick start.

In this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the 
CMP's positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage about
half value of reference voltage.

When running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would change
between logic one and zero when the user's voltage crosses the internal DAC's value. The endless loop in main() function
would detect the logic value of comparator's output, and change the LED. The LED would be turned on when the compare
output is logic one, or turned off when zero.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-KV31F120M board
- Personal Computer
- Elevator Tower

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then change CMP analog input, and watch the change of LED.
    - CMP1_IN0 (Jump A39 on Elevator Tower) connected to VCC =3.3V (Jump A3 on Elevator Tower): LED RED on
    - CMP1_IN0 (Jump A39 on Elevator Tower) connected to GND (Jump A2 on Elevator Tower): LED RED off
