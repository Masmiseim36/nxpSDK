Overview
========
The CRC Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to generate checksums
for an ASCII string. Several CRC protocols are implemented using the CRC driver API.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-KV46F150M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To use UART on board, make sure that J505-3 connects to J505-4, J506-3 connects to J506-4

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
