Overview
========
The FTM project is a demonstration program of generating a combined PWM signal by the SDK FTM driver. It sets up the FTM
hardware block to output PWM signals on two TPM channels. The example also shows the complementary mode of operation
and deadtime insertion.
On boards that have 2 LEDs connected to the FTM pins, the user will see a change in LED brightness.
And if the board do not support LEDs to show, the outputs can be observed by oscilloscope.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.3
- Keil MDK  5.27
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.0.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-KV46F150M board
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
To use UART on board, make sure that J505-3 connects to J505-4, J506-3 connects to J506-4

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FTM example to output combined complementary PWM signals on two channels

You will see a change in LED brightness if an LED is connected to the FTM pin
If no LED is connected to the FTM pin, then probe the signal using an oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use oscilloscope to measure FTM signal output (J501-9 & J501-11)
Customization options
