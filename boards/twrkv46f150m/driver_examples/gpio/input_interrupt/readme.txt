Overview
========
The GPIO Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate the general-purpose
outputs.
The example is supported by the set, clear, and toggle write-only registers for each port output data register. The 
example uses the software button to control/toggle the LED.
Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-KV46F150M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To use UART on board, make sure that J505-3 connects to J505-4, J506-3 connects to J506-4

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GPIO Driver example
Press SW2 to turn on/off a LED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you press the SW2, the LED YELLOW1 will be toggled, and "SW2 is pressed" is shown on the terminal window.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.1
- Keil MDK  5.26
- GCC ARM Embedded  7.3.1
- MCUXpresso 10.3.0
