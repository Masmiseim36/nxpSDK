Overview
========
The GPIO Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate the general-purpose
outputs.
The example is supported by the set, clear, and toggle write-only registers for each port output data register. The 
example take turns to shine the LED.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.29
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-KV46F150M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
To use UART on board, make sure that J505-3 connects to J505-4, J506-3 connects to J506-4

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
