Overview
========
The FTM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK FTM driver. It sets up the FTM
hardware block to output a center-aligned PWM signal. The PWM dutycycle is periodically updated.
On boards that have an LED connected to the FTM pins, the user will see a change in LED brightness.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.32.3
- Keil MDK  5.27
- GCC ARM Embedded  8.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.0.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-KV58F220M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
 Connect J30-1 to J30-2

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
These instructions are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FTM example to output center-aligned PWM signal
You will see a change in LED brightness if an LED is connected to the FTM pin
If no LED is connected to the FTM pin, then probe the signal using an oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use oscilloscope to measure FTM signal output J30-1
