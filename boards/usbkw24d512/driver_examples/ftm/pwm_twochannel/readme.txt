Overview
========
The FTM pwm two channel Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to generate a square 
pulse PWM on 2 channel to control the LED brightness.
- FTM generates a PWM with the increasing and decreasing duty cycle.
- LED brightness is increasing and then dimming. This is a continuous process.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- USB-KW24D512 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect the host PC and the USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FTM example to output PWM on 2 channels
You will see a change in LED brightness if an LED is connected to the FTM pin
If no LED is connected to the FTM pin, then probe the signal using an oscilloscope
