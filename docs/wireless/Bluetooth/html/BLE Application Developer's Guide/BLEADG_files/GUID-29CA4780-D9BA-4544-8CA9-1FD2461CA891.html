    <h1 class="title topictitle1">OTAP client</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">An application running an OTAP Client, before doing any OTAP-related operations, must
            wait for and OTAP Server to connect and perform service and characteristic discovery.
            OTAP transactions can begin only after the OTAP Server writes the OTAP Control point CCC
            Descriptor to receive ATT Notifications. This is the point when bidirectional
            communication is established between the OTAP Server and Client and it is a good point
            to start OTAP transactions.</p>

        <p class="p">The OTAP Client can advertise the OATP Service (which is done in the demo application) or
            the OTAP Server may already know the advertising device has an OTAP Service based on
            application-specific means. In both situations the OTAP Server must discover the handles
            of the OTAP Service and its characteristics.</p>

        <p class="p">Besides the OTAP Service instantiated in the GATT Database the OTAP Client needs to have
            some storage capabilities for the downloaded image file and a bootloader which writes
            the image received over-the-air to the flash memory.</p>

        <p class="p">How to put the OTAP Service in the GATT Database is described in the <em class="ph i">The OTAP Service
                and Characteristics</em> section of this document.</p>

        <p class="p">The upgrade image storage capabilities in the demo OTAP Client applications are handled
            by the <em class="ph i">OtaSupport</em> module from the Framework which contains support modules and
            drivers. The <em class="ph i">OtaSupport</em> module has support for both internal storage (a part of
            the internal flash memory is reserved for storing the upgrade image) and external
            storage (a SPI flash memory chip). The demo applications use external storage. The
            internal storage is viable only if there is enough space in the internal flash for the
            upgrade image – the flash in this case should be at least twice the size of the largest
            application. The <em class="ph i">OtaSupport</em> module also needs the <em class="ph i">Eeprom</em> module from the
            Framework to work correctly.</p>

        <p class="p">A bootloader is also provided as a separate application which is available in both source
            code and executable form. The OTAP Bootloader executable resides in the
                <em class="ph i">\tools\wireless\binaries</em> folder for each board, and has the following format:
                <em class="ph i">bootloader_otap_&lt;BOARD&gt;.bin.</em></p>

        <p class="p">The OTAP Bootloader project resides in the
                <em class="ph i">\boards\&lt;board&gt;\wireless_examples\framework\bootloader_otap</em> folder,
            where &lt;BOARD&gt; is one of the following:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-29CA4780-D9BA-4544-8CA9-1FD2461CA891__UL_A3C_JNN_CY">
            <li class="li">FRDMKW40Z</li>

            <li class="li">USBKW40Z</li>

            <li class="li">FRDMKW41Z</li>

            <li class="li">USBKW41Z</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">The details of the OTAP Bootloader are discussed in a separate section.</p>

        <p class="p">To use the <em class="ph i">OtaSupport</em> module and the OTAP Bootloader several configuration options
            must be set up in both the source files and the linker options of the toolchain.</p>

        <p class="p">First, the <em class="ph i">OTASupport</em> and <em class="ph i">Eeprom</em> module files must be included in the
            project. To configure the type of storage used the <em class="ph i">gEepromType_d</em> preprocessor
            definition must be given a value. </p>

        <p class="p">To use external storage set the <em class="ph i">gEepromType_d </em>value to the appropriate type of
            EEPROM present on the board. The correct value for KW40Z4 demo boards is
                <em class="ph i">gEepromDevice_AT45DB021E_c</em> and the correct value for KW41Z4 demo boards is
                <em class="ph i">gEepromDevice_AT45DB041E_c</em>.</p>

        <p class="p">The valid <em class="ph i">gEepromType_d </em> options can be found in the <em class="ph i">Eeprom.h</em> file:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">/* List of the EEPROM devices used on each of the FSL development boards */
<strong class="ph b">#define</strong> gEepromDevice_None_c 0
<strong class="ph b">#define</strong> gEepromDevice_InternalFlash_c 1
<strong class="ph b">#define</strong> gEepromDevice_AT45DB161E_c 2 /* TWR-KW2x */
<strong class="ph b">#define</strong> gEepromDevice_AT26DF081A_c 3 /* TWR-MEM */
<strong class="ph b">#define</strong> gEepromDevice_AT45DB021E_c 4 /* FRDM-KW40 */
<strong class="ph b">#define</strong> gEepromDevice_AT45DB041E_c 5 /* FRDM-KW41 */</pre>

        <p class="p">The setting of the EEPROM type is done in the <em class="ph i">app_preinclude.h</em> file for the demo
            applications:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">/* Specifies the type of EEPROM available on the target board */
<strong class="ph b">#define</strong> gEepromType_d gEepromDevice_AT45DB041E_c</pre>

        <p class="p">To use internal storage set up the <em class="ph i">gUseInternalStorageLink_d=1</em> symbol in the
            linker configuration window (Linker-&gt;Config tab in the IAR project properties) and
            set the <em class="ph i">gEepromType_d</em> value to <em class="ph i">gEepromDevice_InternalFlash_c</em> in the
                <em class="ph i">app_preinclude.h </em>file:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">/* Specifies the type of EEPROM available on the target board */
<strong class="ph b">#define</strong> gEepromType_d gEepromDevice_InternalFlash_c</pre>

        <p class="p">The OTAP demo applications for the IAR EW IDE have some settings in the Linker options
            tab which must be configured to use <em class="ph i">OtaSupport</em> and the OTAP Bootloader. </p>

        <p class="p">In the <em class="ph i">Project Target Options-&gt;Linker-&gt;Config</em> tab, 3 symbols must be
            correctly defined. To use NVM storage the <em class="ph i">gUseNVMLink_d </em> symbol must be set to 1.
            The <em class="ph i">gUseInternalStorageLink_d</em> symbol must be set to 0 when OTAP external storage
            is used and to 1 when internal storage is used. To enable the OTAP Bootloader linking
            the <em class="ph i">gUseBootloaderLink_d</em> symbol must be set to 1 to offset the application. An
            example configuration window is shown below.</p>

        <div class="fig fignone" id="GUID-29CA4780-D9BA-4544-8CA9-1FD2461CA891__FIG_HMX_VNN_CY"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Linker Config IAR EW IDE - OTAP Client External Storage and Bootloader

        </div>

        <p class="p">The OTAP demo applications for the KDS IDE also have some settings in the project
            properties which must be configured to use <em class="ph i">OtaSupport</em> and the OTAP
            Bootloader.</p>

        <p class="p">First, some Eclipse Build Variables must be set up just as shown in the screenshot below
            in the Project Properties -&gt; C/C++ Build -&gt; Build Variables tab.</p>

        <div class="fig fignone" id="GUID-29CA4780-D9BA-4544-8CA9-1FD2461CA891__FIG_KGC_14N_CY"><span class="figcap">Figure 2. KDS Build Variables - OTAP Client External Storage and Bootloader
                Configuration</span>

        </div>

        <p class="p">After the Build Variables, are set up they must be passed as options to the Compiler and
            Linker command lines.</p>

        <p class="p">For the Compiler go to the Project Properties -&gt; C/C++ Build -&gt; Settings -&gt;
            Build Steps -&gt; Pre-build steps -&gt; Command text box and add
                <em class="ph i">-DgUseBootloaderLink_d=${gUseBootloaderLink_d}
                -DgUseInternalStorageLink_d=${gUseInternalStorageLink_d}</em> if you want to add the
                <em class="ph i">gUseInternalStorageLink_d </em> and the <em class="ph i">gUseBootloaderLink_d </em>variables. The
            preprocessor definitions with the same name as the Eclipse Build Variables are passed to
            the Compiler in the command line with the value of the Eclipse Build Variables.</p>

        <p class="p">For the Linker go to the Project Properties -&gt; C/C++ Build -&gt; Settings -&gt; Tool
            Settings -&gt; Cross ARM C Linker -&gt; Miscellaneous -&gt; Other Linker Flags box and
            add <em class="ph i">-Xlinker -defsym -Xlinker gUseBootloaderLink_d=${gUseBootloaderLink_d} -Xlinker
                -defsym -Xlinker gUseInternalStorageLink_d=${gUseInternalStorageLink_d}</em> if you
            want to add the <em class="ph i">gUseInternalStorageLink_d </em> and the <em class="ph i">gUseBootloaderLink_d
            </em>variables. The Linker Symbols with the same name as the Eclipse Build Variables are
            passed to the Linker in the command line with the value of the Eclipse Build
            Variables.</p>

        <p class="p">Once the application starts and bidirectional OTAP communication is established via the
            OTAP Service then the OTAP Client must determine if the connected OTAP Server has a
            newer image than the one currently present on the device. This can be done in two ways.
            Either the OTAP Server knows by some application-specific means that it has a newer
            image and sends a New Image Notification to the OTAP Client or the OTAP Client sends a
            New Image Info Request to the OTAP Server and waits for a response. The example
            application uses the second method. The New Image Info Request contains enough
            information about the currently running image to allow the OTAP Server to determine if
            it has a newer image for the requesting device. The New Image Info Response contains
            enough information for the OTAP Client to determine that de “advertised” image is newer
            and it wants to download it. The best method is entirely dependent on application
            requirements.</p>

        <p class="p">An example function which checks if an <em class="ph i">ImageVerison</em> field from a New Image
            Notification or a New Image Info Response corresponds to a newer image (based on the
            suggested format of this field) is provided in the OTAP Client demo applications. The
            function is called <em class="ph i">OtapClient_IsRemoteImageNewer()</em>.</p>

        <p class="p">The OTAP Client application is a little more complicated than the OTAP Server application
            because more state information needs to be handled (current image position, current
            chink sequence number, image file parsing information, and so on). An example state
            diagram for the OTAP Client is shown below. Note that some of the states may not be
            explicitly present in the demo applications, this diagram is meant to emphasize the
            steps of the image download process.</p>

        <div class="fig fignone" id="GUID-29CA4780-D9BA-4544-8CA9-1FD2461CA891__FIG_GKR_D4N_CY"><span class="figcap">Figure 3. OTAP Client Example State Diagram</span>
            
            <img class="image" id="GUID-29CA4780-D9BA-4544-8CA9-1FD2461CA891__IMAGE_J3M_G4N_CY" src="GUID-9ABE8F68-9659-411E-92D8-28688FC2A531-high.png"/>
        </div>

        <p class="p">After the OTAP Client determines that the peer OTAP Server has a suitable upgrade image
            available it can start the download process. This is done by sending multiple Image
            Block Request messages and waiting for the Image Chunks via the selected transfer
            method. </p>

        <p class="p">While receiving the image file blocks the OTAP Client application parses the image file
            and if any parameter of an image file sub-element is invalid or the image file format is
            invalid it sends an Error Notification to the OTAP Server and tries to restart the
            download process from the beginning or a known good position.</p>

        <p class="p">When an Image Chunk received its sequence number is checked and its content is parsed in
            the context of the image file format. If the sequence number is not as expected then the
            block transfer is restarted from the last known good position. When all chunks of an
            Image Block are received ne next block is requested if there are more blocks to
            download. When the last Image Block in an Image File is received then the image
            integrity is checked (the received CRC from the Image File CRC sub-element is compared
            to the computed CRC). The computed image integrity initialization and intermediary value
            must be reset to 0 before starting the download of an image and when restarting the
            download of an image. If the image integrity check fails then the image download process
            is restarted from the beginning. If the image integrity check is successful then the
            Bootloader is triggered, an Image Download Complete message is sent to the OTAP Server
            and the MCU is restarted. After the restart the bootloader kicks in and writes the new
            image to the flash memory and gives CPU control to the newly installed application.</p>

        <p class="p">If at any time during the download process a Link Layer disconnection occurs then the
            image download process is restarted from the last known good position when the link is
            reestablished.</p>

        <p class="p">As noted earlier the OTAP Client application needs to handle a lot of state information.
            In the demo application all this information is held in the <em class="ph i">otapClientData</em>
            structure of the <em class="ph i">otapClientAppData_t</em> type. The type is defined and the structure
            is initialized in the <em class="ph i">app.c</em> file of the application. This structure is defined
            and initialized differently for the OTAP Client ATT and L2CAP example applications.
            Mainly the <em class="ph i">transferMethod</em> member of the structure is constant and has different
            values for the two example applications and the L2CAP application structure has an extra
            member.</p>

        <p class="p">To receive write notifications when the OTAP Server writes the OTAP Control Point
            attribute and ATT Confirmations when it indicates the OTAP Control Point attribute, the
            OTAP Client application must register a GATT Server callback and enable write
            notifications for the OTAP Control Point attribute. This is done in the
                <em class="ph i">BleApp_Config()</em> function in the <em class="ph i">app.c</em> file.</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock"><strong class="ph b">static</strong> uint16_t otapWriteNotifHandles[] = {value_otap_control_point,
                                                             value_otap_data};
