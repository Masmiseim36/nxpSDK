    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Introduction</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">This document explains how to integrate the BluetoothÂ® Low Energy (BLE) Host
            Stack in a BLE application and provides detailed explanation of the most commonly used
            APIs and code examples.</p>

        <p class="p">The document also sets out the prerequisites and the initialization of the BLE Host
            Stack, followed by the presentation of APIs grouped by layers and by application role,
            as described below.</p>

        <p class="p">First, the Generic Access Profile (GAP) layer is divided into two sections according to
            the GAP role of the device: Central and Peripheral.</p>

        <p class="p">The basic setup of two such devices is explained with code examples, such as how to
            prepare the devices for connections, how to connect them together, and pairing and
            bonding processes.</p>

        <p class="p">Next, the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) layer introduces the APIs required for data
            transfer between the two connected devices. Again, the chapter is divided into two
            sections according to the GATT role of the device: Client and Server.</p>

        <p class="p">The document further describes the usage of the GATT Database APIs in the application to
            manipulate the data in the GATT server database.</p>

        <p class="p">Then, the document shows a user-friendly method to statically build a GATT Database. The
            method involves the use of a predefined set of macros that the application may include
            to build the database at application compile-time.</p>

        <p class="p">The following section contains instructions on how to build a custom profile. The
            subsequent section is dedicated to the structure of the typical application.</p>

        <p class="p">Additionally, the document has a chapter dedicated to low-power management and how the
            low-power modes of the hardware of the software can be used by an application.</p>

        <p class="p">The next section contains a description of the Over The Air Programming (OTAP)
            capabilities offered by the Host Stack via a dedicated Service/Profile and how to use
            them in an application. This section also contains a detailed description of the
            components of the Framework involved in the OTAP process and the Bootloader application,
            which does the actual upgrade of the image on a device.</p>

        <p class="p">Finally, the document has a section, which describes how to build a BLE application when
            the Host Stack is running on a separate processor.</p>
