    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Protocol design considerations</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The OTAP Client is a GAP Peripheral thus a device which has limited resources. This is
            why the OTAP Protocol was designed in such a way that it is the discretion of the OTAP
            Client if, when, how fast and how much of an available upgrade image is transferred from
            the OTAP Server. The OTAP Client also decides which is the image transfer method based
            on its capabilities. Two image transfer methods are supported at this moment: the ATT
            Transfer Method and the L2CAP PSM CoC Transfer Method.</p>

        <p class="p">The ATT Transfer Method is supported by all devices which support Bluetooth Low Energy
            but it has the disadvantage of a small data payload size and a larger BLE stack
            protocols overhead leading to a lower throughput. This disadvantage has been somewhat
            reduced by the introduction of the Long Frames feature in the Bluetooth Low Energy
            specification 4.2 Link Layer which allows for a larger ATT_MTU value. The L2CAP PSM CoC
            Transfer Method is an optional feature available for devices running a Bluetooth stack
            version 4.1 and later. The protocol overhead is smaller and the data payload is higher
            leading to a high throughput. The L2CAP PSM Transfer Method is the preferred transfer
            method and it is available on all BLE Devices if the application requires it.</p>

        <p class="p">Based on application requirements and device resources and capabilities the OTAP Clients
            can request blocks of OTAP images divided into chunks. To minimize the protocol overhead
            and maximize throughput an OTAP Client makes a data block request specifying the block
            size and the chunk size and the OTAP Server sends the requested data chunks (which have
            a sequence number) without waiting for confirmation. The block size, chunk size and
            number of chunks per block are limited and suitable values must be used based on
            application needs.</p>

        <p class="p">The OTAP Client can stop or restart an image block transfer at any time if the
            application requires it or a transfer error occurs. The OTAP Server implementation can
            be almost completely stateless. The OTAP Server does not need to remember what parts of
            an image have been transferred, this is the job of the OTAP Client which can request any
            part of an image at any time. This allows it to download parts of the image whenever and
            how fast its resources allow it. The OTAP Server simply sends image information and
            image parts on request.</p>

        <p class="p">The BLE OTAP Protocol is designed to be used not only on BLE transport medium but on any
            transport medium, for example a serial communication interface or another type of
            wireless interface. This may be useful when transferring an upgrade image from a PC or a
            mobile device to the OTAP Server to be sent via BLE to the OTAP Clients which require
            it. In the OTAP Demo Applications the embedded OTAP Server relays OTAP commands between
            an OTAP Client and a PC via a serial interface and using a FSCI type protocol.
            Effectively the OTAP Client downloads the upgrade image from the PC and not from the
            OTAP Server. Other transfer methods may be used based on application needs.</p>
