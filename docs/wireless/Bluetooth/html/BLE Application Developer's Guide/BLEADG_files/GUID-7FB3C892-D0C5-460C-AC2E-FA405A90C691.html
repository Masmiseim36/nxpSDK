    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The ARM® Cortex®-M0+ CPU and the BLE Link Layer hardware have their own power modes.
            Thus, a low-power mode for the KW4x SoC is a combination between a BLE Link Layer power
            mode and an MCU low-power mode. </p>

        <p class="p">For the MCU, there are two types of low-power modes defined, sleep modes (based on the
            ARM architecture sleep modes) and deep sleep modes (based on the ARM architecture deep
            sleep modes). Only deep sleep modes are of interest in this document, and the MCU deep
            sleep modes used by this component are LLS3 and VLLS0/1. </p>

        <p class="p">The BLE Link Layer also has a sleep and a deep sleep mode, but only deep sleep mode is
            used by this component. To function, the BLE Link layer needs a clock from the RF
            Reference Oscillator and requests it through a signal called BLE Sysclk Request. This
            signal is monitored by the RSIM module, and, when it is asserted high an interrupt
            request is generated by RSIM. This interrupt can be configured in LLWU to wake up the
            system. Upon entering deep sleep, the BLE Link Layer de-asserts the BLE Sysclk Request
            since the RF clock is not needed in deep sleep. With a programmable timeout before BLE
            reference clock register reaches the value in the BLE wakeup instant register during
            deep sleep, the BLE link Layer asserts BLE Sysclk Request again. If the RSIM module is
            enabled to generate an interrupt on this event, and this interrupt is configured in LLWU
            module to wake up the chip, the BLE link layer wakes up the entire SoC just before it
            exits DSM. </p>
