    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">A Resolvable Private Address (RPA) is a random address generated using a Identity
            Resolving Key (IRK). This address appears completely random to an outside observer, so a
            device may periodically regenerate its RPA to maintain privacy, as there is no
            correlation between any two different RPAs generated using the same IRK.</p>

        <p class="p">On the other hand, an IRK can also be used to resolve an RPA, in other words, to check if
            this RPA has been generated with this IRK. This process is called “resolving the
            identity of a device”. Whoever has the IRK of a device can always try to resolve its
            identity against an RPA.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, let’s assume device A is frequently changing its RPA using IRKA. At some
            point, A bonds with B. A must give B a way to recognize it in a subsequent connection
            when it (A) has a different address. To achieve this purpose, A distributes the IRKA
            during the Key Distribution phase of the pairing process. B stores the IRKA it received
            from A.</p>

        <p class="p">Later, B connects to a device X that uses RPAX. This address appears completely random,
            but B can try to resolve RPAX using IRKA. If the resolving operation is successful, it
            means that IRKA was used to generate RPAX, and since IRKA belongs to device A, it means
            that X is A. So B was able to recognize the identity of device X, but nobody else can do
            that since they don’t have IRKA.</p>
