    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Deep sleep mode 1</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">This low-power mode was designed to be used when the BLE stack is active. An example for
            a node in advertising is shown below:</p>

        <div class="fig fignone" id="GUID-9CB62BD0-41BD-46F3-AF28-6FD02EE60DC9__FIG_CDW_VDG_CY"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Deep Sleep Mode 1 usage example</span>
            
            <img class="image" src="GUID-2A413C19-F3A4-416F-9199-75888CE5956F-high.png"/>
        </div>

        <p class="p">In this mode, the MCU enters LLS3 and BLE Link Layer enters deep sleep. The SoC wakes up
            from this mode by GPIOs configured as wake-up source in
                <em class="ph i">BOARD_LLWU_PIN_ENABLE_BITMAP</em>, LPTMR timeout using LLWU module , or by BLE
            Link Layer wakeup interrupt (BLE_LL reference clock reaches wake up instance register)
            using LLWU module. LPTMR timer is used to measure the time MCU spends in deep sleep in
            order to synchronize low-power timers at wakeup. There are two ways to use this
            mode:</p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"> The BLE stack decides it can enter low-power and calls
                    <em class="ph i">PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep</em>. If no other software entity prevents the system
                from entering deep sleep (all software layers that called
                    <em class="ph i">PWR_DisallowDeviceToSleep</em> have called back <em class="ph i">PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep</em>)
                and the system reaches idle task, <em class="ph i">PWR_EnterLowPower</em> function is entered and
                the system prepares for entering low-power mode 1. BLE Link layer status is checked
                and found not to be in deep sleep. A function from BLE stack is called to get the
                nearest instant at which the BLE Link layer needs to be running again and the wakeup
                instant register in the BLE Link layer is programmed with this value. The BLE link
                layer is then put in deep sleep and the MCU enters LLS3. </li>

            <li class="li"> The BLE stack decides it can enter low-power and calls <em class="ph i">PWR_BLE_EnterDSM </em>
                followed by <em class="ph i">PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep</em>. In this way the BLE Link layer is put to
                deep sleep immediately, the MCU remaining to enter LLS3 on idle task. If no other
                software entity prevents the system from entering deep sleep (all software layers
                that called <em class="ph i">PWR_DisallowDeviceToSleep</em> have called back
                    <em class="ph i">PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep</em>) and the system reaches idle task,
                    <em class="ph i">PWR_EnterLowPower</em> function is entered and the system prepares to complete
                entering low-power mode 1. BLE Link layer status is checked and found to be in deep
                sleep, so the MCU puts itself in LLS3 and deep sleep mode 1 finally reached. </li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">The timeout is <em class="ph i">cPWR_BLE_LL_OscStartupDelay</em> +
                <em class="ph i">cPWR_BLE_LL_OffsetToWakeupInstant</em> before BLE link layer reference clock
            register reaches the value in wakeup register, BLE Link Layer wakes up the entire SoC
            and the system resumes its activity. Check <em class="ph i">PWR_Configuration.h</em> header file for
            the two defines.</p>
