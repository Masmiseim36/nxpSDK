    <h1 class="title topictitle1">OTAP bootloader</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The OTAP Bootloader is a program which resides in a reserved area of the flash memory of
            the device. It starts before the application, checks some dedicated new image flags in
            non-volatile memory and if they are set it proceeds to replace the current running
            application image with a new image received over-the-air. The new image can be retrieved
            from external or internal storage depending on the configuration and available memory
            resources of the device. After the bootloader copies the new image it resets the
            MCU.</p>

        <p class="p">If the new image flags are not set then the OTAP Bootloader simply gives control of the
            MCU to the current application immediately.</p>

        <p class="p">If the image upgrade progress is interrupted before it is finished (by a power loss for
            example) the bootloader restarts the copy procedure on the next MCU reset. It uses some
            flags in non-volatile memory to do this which are set only when the image copy process
            has been completed successfully.</p>

        <p class="p">The OTAP Bootloader project and source code can be found in the
                <em class="ph i">\boards\&lt;board&gt;\wireless_examples\framework\bootloader_otap\</em>
            folder.</p>

        <p class="p">For each target board a different executable image is generated. For the FRDMKW41Z demo
            boards the <em class="ph i">bootloader_otap_frdmkw41z.bin </em>is the appropriate bootloader binary
            image file.</p>

        <p class="p">The next figure shows the memory layout of the device with the relevant sections and
            their size: the bootloader, the application and the reserved areas for the situation
            where external storage is used for the image received over-the-air.</p>

        <div class="fig fignone" id="GUID-AEB7F621-9BF2-419C-B268-1A59521D6DFC__FIG_XKZ_BMT_CY"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Device Memory Layout – External Image Storage</span>

        </div>

        <p class="p">The OTAP Bootloader image occupies the first part of the flash memory. In the current
            implementation it has a reserved area of 1/32 of the flash size regardless of the actual
            size of the image.</p>

        <p class="p">The OTAP Bootloader is configured to not overwrite itself so any image sent over the air
            must <strong class="ph b">not</strong> contain the Bootloader application in the reserved section. See the The
            OTAP Client section which describes how the Bootloader application can be added to your
            image.</p>

        <p class="p">A typical application image has its memory divided into multiple sections.</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-AEB7F621-9BF2-419C-B268-1A59521D6DFC__UL_H1W_HMT_CY">
            <li class="li">The ISR_TABLE section contains the MCU interrupt table, it has a fixed reserved
                size.</li>

            <li class="li">The BOOT_FLAGS section contains bootloader flags and the target bootloader version.
                The OTAP Bootloader looks for this section immediately after the ISR_TABLE section
                which has a fixed size.<ul class="ul" id="GUID-AEB7F621-9BF2-419C-B268-1A59521D6DFC__UL_NBW_HMT_CY">
                    <li class="li">New Image Flag – set by the application to tell the OTAP Bootloader that a
                        new image is available. This flag is set by calling the
                            <em class="ph i">OTA_SetNewImageFlag()</em> function from the <em class="ph i">OtaSupport</em>
                        module.</li>

                    <li class="li">Image Upgrade Complete Flag – set by the OTAP Bootloader when the new image
                        copy process is completed successfully.</li>

                    <li class="li">Bootloader Version – bootloader version expected by the application – set at
                        compile time.</li>

                </ul>
</li>

            <li class="li">The APPLICATION section contains actual application code<ul class="ul" id="GUID-AEB7F621-9BF2-419C-B268-1A59521D6DFC__UL_CCW_HMT_CY">
                    <li class="li">The optional application non-volatile memory (NVM_STORAGE) area is placed
                        right before the FSL_PROD_DATA section if it is present.</li>

                    <li class="li">The optional internal image storage area (OTAP_INTERNAL_IMAGE_STORAGE) is
                        placed before the non-volatile memory area if it the non-volatile memory
                        area is present or before the FSL_PROD_DATA section if the non-volatile
                        memory area is not present.</li>

                </ul>
</li>

            <li class="li">The NVM_STOARGE section contains data which the application wishes to save between
                device power cycles.</li>

            <li class="li">The OTAP_INTERNAL_IMAGE_STORAGE section is a reserved space where an image received
                over-the-air is stored before it is copied over the APPLICATION section when the
                OTAP Bootloader is triggered.</li>

            <li class="li">The FSL_PROD_DATA section contains the location of the upgrade image. The location
                is a 32bit number which is set at compile time. It is set to 0xFFFFFFFF if external
                SPI flash storage is used or to a location inside the internal flash memory (which
                is always smaller than 0xFFFFFFFF) if internal image storage is used. This is
                necessary for the OTAP Bootloader to know the source of the upgrade image. This
                location in the flash memory is written with the correct value for the type of
                storage used (internal or external) when the <em class="ph i">OTA_StartImage()</em> function is
                called.</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">When internal storage is used for the image received over-the-air the memory layout
            changes as shown in the following image.</p>

        <div class="fig fignone" id="GUID-AEB7F621-9BF2-419C-B268-1A59521D6DFC__FIG_MLB_KMT_CY"><span class="figcap">Figure 2. Device Memory Layout – Internal Image Storage</span>

        </div>

        <p class="p">The OTAP Bootloader expects a certain image format in the image storage location which is
            identical regardless if the storage is internal or external.</p>
