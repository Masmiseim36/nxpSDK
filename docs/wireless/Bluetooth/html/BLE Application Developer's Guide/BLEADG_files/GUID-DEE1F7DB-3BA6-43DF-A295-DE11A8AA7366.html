    <h1 class="title topictitle1">FSCI host layer</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The BLE GAP, GATT, GATTDB and L2CAP API included in the BLE interface is implemented as a
            FSCI Host Layer that has to be added to the BLE Application project when it resides on a
            separate processor than the BLE stack.</p>

        <p class="p">This layer is responsible for serializing API to corresponding FSCI commands, sending
            them to the blackbox, receiving and deserializing FSCI statuses and events, presenting
            them to the BLE Application and arbitrating access from multiple tasks to the serial
            interface.</p>

        <p class="p">All the GAP, GATT, GATTDB and L2CAP API is executed asynchronously, so the user context
            will block waiting for the response from the blackbox, which may be the status of the
            request and optionally a FSCI event that includes the out parameters of a synchronous
            function. </p>

        <p class="p">There are also functions with out parameters that are not executed synchronously and they
            will be provided asynchronously through a later FSCI event. It is the responsibility of
            the FSCI Host layer to keep the application allocated memory between the time of the
            request and the completion of the event with the actual values of the out parameters and
            populate them accordingly.</p>

        <p class="p">The BLE API execution inside the FSCI Host layer will first wait for gaining access to
            the serial interface through a mutex. Once the access gained, the FSCI request is sent
            to the serial interface to the blackbox. Then, by default, the serial interface response
            is received by polling until the whole FSCI packet is received. The other option
            available is to block the user task to wait for an OS event that will be set by the FSCI
            module when the status is received. For more information on this, see the Connectivity
            Framework document on the FSCI module.</p>

        <p class="p">The API can have out paramteres that are to be received immediately after the status of
            the request. If so and the status of the request is success, the polling mechanism will
            continue to receive the whole FSCI packet of the BLE event and get the out parameters
            and fill the values in the application provided memory space. After obtaining the status
            and optionally the event, the execution of the request is considered completed, the
            mutex to the serial interface is unlocked and the execution flow is returned to the user
            calling context.</p>
