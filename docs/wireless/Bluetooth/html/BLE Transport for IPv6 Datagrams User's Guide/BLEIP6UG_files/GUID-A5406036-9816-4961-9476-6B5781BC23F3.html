    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The IPV6 Router behaves as a GAP central node. It enters GAP Limited
            Discovery Procedure and searches for IPV6 nodes to connect with. When the IPV6 Router
            connects, it initiates a LE Credit Based Connection request. </p>

        <p class="p">The IPV6 Node behaves as a GAP peripheral node. It enters GAP General
            Discoverable Mode and waits for a GAP central node to connect. When the IPv6 Router
            connects, it initiates a LE Credit Based Connection request. </p>

        <p class="p">When the credit based connection is set, the user can send data through the
            credit based channel from each device. When the device knows that the peer is out of
            credit, it automatically requests new credit from the application. The application then
            sends new credits to the peer. The examples use pairing with bonding by default. When
            connected with the IPv6 Node application, the IPv6 Router sends the 999999 passcode to
            the host stack by default.</p>

        <p class="p">The setup requires minumim of two FRDM-KW41Z platforms, one for the IPv6 Node
            and the other for the IPv6 Router. Optionally, a third board could be used for a second
            IPv6 Node connected to the IPv6 Router.</p>

        <p class="p">Open serial port terminals and connect them to the boards, in the same manner as described in Bluetooth Low Energy Demo Applications Userâ€™s Guide. The start screen is displayed after the board is reset. At first, all LEDs are flashing on both devices.</p>
