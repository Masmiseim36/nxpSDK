    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Pairing and bonding</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">After a connection has been established to a Central, the Peripheral’s role regarding
            security is a passive one. It is the Central’s responsibility to either start the
            pairing process or, if the devices have already bonded in the past, to encrypt the link
            using the shared LTK.</p>

        <p class="p">If the Central attempts to access sensitive data without authenticating, the Peripheral
            sends error responses (at ATT level) with proper error code (Insufficient
            Authentication, Insufficient Encryption, Insufficient Authorization, and so on), thus
            indicating to the Central that it needs to perform security procedures.</p>

        <p class="p">All security checks are performed internally by the GAP module and the security error
            responses are sent automatically. All the application developer needs to do is register
            the security requirements.</p>

        <p class="p">First, when building the GATT Database (see <a class="xref" href="GUID-C9D692A7-076C-4A9B-BEB3-74E17F41C5A7.html#GUID-C9D692A7-076C-4A9B-BEB3-74E17F41C5A7">Creating GATT database</a>), the sensitive attributes should have the security built into their
            access permissions (for example, read-only / read with authentication / write with
            authentication / write with authorization, and so on.).</p>

        <p class="p">Second, if the GATT Database requires additional security besides that already specified
            in attribute permissions (for example, certain services require higher security in
            certain situations), the following function must be called:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t<strong class="ph b">Gap_RegisterDeviceSecurityRequirements</strong>
(
    gapDeviceSecurityRequirements_t * pSecurity
);</pre>

        <p class="p">The parameter is a pointer to a structure which contains a “device master security
            setting” and service-specific security settings. All these security requirements are
            pointers to <em class="ph i">gapSecurityRequirements_t</em> structures. The pointers that are to be
            ignored should be set to <em class="ph i">NULL</em>.</p>

        <p class="p">Although the Peripheral does not initiate any kind of security procedure, it can inform
            the Central about its security requirements. This is usually done immediately after the
            connection to avoid exchanging useless packets for requests that might be denied because
            of insufficient security.</p>

        <p class="p">The informing is performed through the Slave Security Request packet at SMP level. To use
            it, the following GAP API is provided:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t<strong class="ph b">Gap_SendSlaveSecurityRequest</strong>
(
    deviceId_t                    deviceId,
    const gapPairingParameters_t* pPairingParameters   
);</pre>

        
        
        <p class="p">The gapPairingParameters_t structure includes two important fields. The withBonding field indicates to the Central whether this Peripheral can bond and the securityModeAndLevel field informs about the required security mode and level that the Central should pair for. See Section 4.1.3 for an explanation about
            security modes and levels, as defined by the GAP module.</p>

        <p class="p">This request expects no reply, nor any immediate action from the Central. The Central may
            easily choose to ignore the Slave Security Request.</p>

        <p class="p">If the two devices have bonded in the past, the Peripheral should expect to
            receive a <em class="ph i">gConnEvtLongTermKeyRequest_c</em> connection event (unless LE Secure
            Connections Pairing was performed, as specified in Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 and above), which means that
            the Central has also recognized the bond and, instead of pairing, it goes directly to
            encrypting the link using the previously shared LTK. At this point, the local LE
            Controller requests that the Host provides the same LTK it exchanged during pairing. </p>

        <p class="p">When the devices have been previously paired, along with the Peripheral’s LTK, the EDIV
            (2 bytes) and RAND (8 bytes) values were also sent (their meaning is defined by the
            SMP). Therefore, before providing the key to the Controller, the application should
            check that the two values match with those received in the
                <em class="ph i">gConnEvtLongTermKeyRequest_c</em> event. If they do, the application should reply
            with:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t<strong class="ph b">Gap_ProvideLongTermKey</strong>
(
    deviceId_t         deviceId,
    const uint8_t      aLtk,
    uint8_t            ltkSize
);</pre>

        <p class="p">The LTK size cannot exceed the maximum value of 16.</p>

        <p class="p">If the EDIV and RAND values do not match, or if the Peripheral does not recognize the
            bond, it can reject the encryption request with:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t<strong class="ph b">Gap_DenyLongTermKey</strong>
(
    deviceId_t deviceId
);</pre>

        <p class="p">If LE SC Pairing was used then the LTK is generated internally by the host stack and it
            is not requested from the application during post-bonding link encryption. In this
            scenario, the application is only notified of the link encryption through the
                <em class="ph i">gConnEvtEncryptionChanged_c</em> connection event.</p>

        <p class="p">If the devices are not bonded, the Peripheral should expect to receive the
                <em class="ph i">gConnEvtPairingRequest_c</em>, indicating that the Central has initiated
            pairing.</p>

        <p class="p">If the application agrees with the pairing parameters (see <a class="xref" href="GUID-AFDE6CF0-C8BC-41A2-987B-D39B341A92E3.html#GUID-AFDE6CF0-C8BC-41A2-987B-D39B341A92E3">Pairing and bonding</a> for detailed explanations), it can reply with:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t<strong class="ph b">Gap_AcceptPairingRequest</strong>
(
    deviceId_t                       deviceId,
    const gapPairingParameters_t *   pPairingParameters
);</pre>

        <p class="p">This time, the Peripheral sends its own pairing parameters, as defined by the SMP. </p>

        <p class="p">After sending this response, the application should expect to receive the
            same pairing events as the Central (see <a class="xref" href="GUID-AFDE6CF0-C8BC-41A2-987B-D39B341A92E3.html#GUID-AFDE6CF0-C8BC-41A2-987B-D39B341A92E3">Pairing and bonding</a>), with one exception: the <em class="ph i">gConnEvtPasskeyRequest_c</em> event is
            not called if the application sets the Passkey (PIN) for pairing before the connection
            by calling the API:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t<strong class="ph b">Gap_SetLocalPasskey</strong>
(
    uint32_t passkey
);</pre>

        <p class="p">This is done because, usually, the Peripheral has a static secret PIN that it distributes
            only to trusted devices. If, for any reason, the Peripheral must dynamically change the
            PIN, it can call the aforementioned function every time it wants to, before the pairing
            starts (for example, right before sending the pairing response with
                <em class="ph i">Gap_AcceptPairingRequest</em>).</p>

        <p class="p">If the Peripheral application never calls <em class="ph i">Gap_SetLocalPasskey</em>, then the
                <em class="ph i">gConnEvtPasskeyRequest_c</em> event is sent to the application as usual.</p>

        <p class="p">The following API can be used by the Peripheral to reject the pairing process:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t<strong class="ph b">Gap_RejectPairing</strong>
(
deviceId_t                         deviceId,
gapAuthenticationRejectReason_t    reason
);</pre>

        <p class="p">The <em class="ph i">reason</em> should indicate why the application rejects the pairing. The value
                <em class="ph i">gLinkEncryptionFailed_c</em> is reserved for the
                <em class="ph i">gConnEvtAuthenticationRejected_c</em> connection event to indicate the link
            encryption failure rather than pairing failures. Therefore, it is not meant as a pairing
            reject reason.</p>

        <p class="p">The <em class="ph i">Gap_RejectPairing</em> function may be called not only after the Pairing Request
            was received, but also during the pairing process, when handling pairing events or
            asynchronously, if for any reason the Peripheral decides to abort the pairing. This also
            holds true for the Central.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="p">For both the Central and the Peripheral, bonding is performed internally and is not the
            application’s concern. The application is informed about whether or not bonding occurred
            through the <em class="ph i">gConnEvtPairingComplete_c</em> event parameters.</p>
