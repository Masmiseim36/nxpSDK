    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Attribute write notifications</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">When the GATT Client reads and writes values from/into the Server’s GATT Database, it
            uses ATT Requests.</p>

        <p class="p">The GATT Server module implementation manages these requests and, according to the
            database security settings and the Client’s security status (authenticated, authorized,
            and so on), automatically sends the ATT Responses without notifying the application.</p>

        <p class="p">There are however some situations where the application needs to be informed of ATT
            packet exchanges. For example, a lot of standard profiles define, for certain Services,
            some, so-called, Control-Point Characteristics. These are Characteristics whose values
            are only of immediate significance to the application. Writing these Characteristics
            usually triggers specific actions.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, consider a fictitious Smart Lamp. It has Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity in the Peripheral
            role and it contains a small GATT Database with a Lamp Service (among other Services).
            The Lamp Service contains two Characteristics: the Lamp State Characteristic (LSC) and
            the Lamp Action Characteristic (LAC).</p>

        <p class="p">LSC is a “normal” Characteristic with Read and Write properties. Its value is either 0,
            lamp off, or 1, lamp on). Writing the value sets the lamp in the desired state. Reading
            it provides its current state, which is only useful when passing the information
            remotely.</p>

        <p class="p">The LAC has only one property, which is Write Without Response. The user can use the
            Write Without Response procedure to write only the value 0x01 (all other values are
            invalid). Whenever the user writes 0x01 in LAC, the lamp switches its state.</p>

        <p class="p">The LAC is a good example of a Control-Point Characteristic for these reasons:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-72E9C55D-3253-4B5E-A32A-F4FAF270A366__UL_CQZ_BP3_BY">
            <li class="li">Writing a certain value (in this case 0x01) triggers an action on the lamp.</li>

            <li class="li">The value the user writes has immediate significance only (“0x01 switches the lamp”)
                and is never used again in the future. For this reason, it does not need to be
                stored in the database.</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">Obviously, whenever a Control-Point Characteristic is written, the application must be
            notified to trigger some application-specific action.</p>

        <p class="p">The GATT Server allows the application to register a set of attribute handles as
            “write-notifiable”, in other words, the application wants to receive an event each time
            any of these attributes is written by the peer Client.</p>

        <p class="p">All Control-Point Characteristics in the GATT Database must have their Value handle
            registered. In fact, the application may register any other handle for write
            notifications for its own purposes with the following API:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t<strong class="ph b">GattServer_RegisterHandlesForWriteNotifications</strong>
(
    uint8_t         handleCount,
    const uint16_t *      aAttributeHandles
);</pre>

        <p class="p">The <em class="ph i">handleCount</em> is the size of the <em class="ph i">aAttributeHandles</em> array and it cannot
            exceed <em class="ph i">gcGattMaxHandleCountForWriteNotifications_c</em>.</p>

        <p class="p">After an attribute handle has been registered with this function, whenever the Client
            attempts to write its value, the GATT Server Callback is triggered with one of the
            following event types:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-72E9C55D-3253-4B5E-A32A-F4FAF270A366__UL_EY5_KP3_BY">
            <li class="li"><em class="ph i">gEvtAttributeWritten_c</em> is triggered when the attribute is written with a
                Write procedure (ATT Write Request). In this instance, the application has to decide
                whether the written value is valid and whether it must be written in the database,
                and, if so, the application must write the value with the
                    <em class="ph i">GattDb_WriteAttribute</em>, see Chapter 6. At this point, the GATT Server
                module does not automatically send the ATT Write Response over the air. Instead, it
                waits for the application to call this function:</li>

        </ul>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t<strong class="ph b">GattServer_SendAttributeWrittenStatus</strong>
(
    deviceId_t     deviceId,
    uint16_t       attributeHandle,
    uint8_t        status
);</pre>

        <p class="p">The value of the <em class="ph i">status</em> parameter is interpreted as an ATT Error Code. It must be
            equal to the <em class="ph i">gAttErrCodeNoError_c</em> (0x00) if the value is valid and it is
            successfully processed by the application. Otherwise, it must be equal to a
            profile-specific error code (in interval 0xE0-0xFF) or an application-specific error
            code (in interval 0x80-0x9F).</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-72E9C55D-3253-4B5E-A32A-F4FAF270A366__UL_DVD_SP3_BY">
            <li class="li"><em class="ph i">gEvtAttributeWrittenWithoutResponse_c</em> is triggered when the attribute is
                written with a Write Without Response procedure (ATT Write Command). Because this
                procedure expects no response, the application may process it and, if necessary,
                write it in the database. Regardless of whether the value is valid or not, no
                response is needed from the application.</li>

            <li class="li"><em class="ph i">gEvtLongCharacteristicWritten_c</em> is triggered when the Client has completed
                writing a Long Characteristic value; the event data includes the handle of the
                Characteristic Value attribute and a pointer to its value in the database.</li>

        </ul>
