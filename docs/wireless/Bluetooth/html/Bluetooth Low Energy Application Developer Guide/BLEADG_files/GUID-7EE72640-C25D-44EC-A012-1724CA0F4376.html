    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Central setup</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <div class="p">The application configures the extended scanning by going through the
            following states: <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">Start scanning by
                        calling:<pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t Gap_StartScanning
(
    const gapScanningParameters_t*    pScanningParameters,
    gapScanningCallback_t       scanningCallback,
    gapFilterDuplicates_t       enableFilterDuplicates,
    uint16_t                    duration,
    uint16_t                    period
)           </pre>
<p class="p">Application may use the default set of parameters
                            <em class="ph i">gGapDefaultExtScanningParameters_d</em>. If the
                            <em class="ph i">pScanningParameters</em> pointer is NULL, the latest set of parameters
                        are used. The <em class="ph i">scanningPHYs</em> parameter indicates the PHYs on which the
                        advertising packets should be received on the <strong class="ph b">primary advertising
                            channel</strong>. As a result, permitted values for the parameter are 0x01
                        (scan LE 1M), 0x04 (scan LE Coded) and 0x05 (scan both LE 1M and LE Coded).
                        There are no strict timing rules for scanning, yet if both PHYs are enabled
                        for scanning, the scan interval value must be large enough to accommodate
                        two scan windows (<em class="ph i">interval</em> &gt;= 2 * <em class="ph i">window</em>).</p>
<p class="p">If the advertiser uses legacy advertising PDUs, the device may
                        actively scan by sending a SCAN_REQ PDU to the advertiser on the LE 1M
                        primary advertising channel (no secondary channel in legacy advertising).
                        Respectively, if the advertiser uses extended advertising PDUs, the active
                        scan operation takes place on the secondary advertising channel. After the
                        device receives a scannable ADV_EXT_IND PDU on the primary advertising
                        channel (PHY LE 1M or Coded), it starts listening for the AUX_ADV_IND PDU on
                        the secondary advertising channel (PHY 1M, 2M or Coded). Once received, the
                        device sends an AUX_SCAN_REQ to the advertiser. Next, an AUX_SCAN_RSP PDU
                        should be received, containing the scan response data.</p>
<p class="p">Application should wait for a <em class="ph i">gScanStateChanged_c</em> or a
                            <em class="ph i">gScanCommandFailed_c</em> in the Scanning Callback.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">Collect information by waiting for <em class="ph i">gDeviceScanned_c</em> (legacy advertising
                    PDUs) or <em class="ph i">gExtDeviceScanned_c</em> (extended advertising PDUs) event in the
                    Scanning Callback. The <em class="ph i">gExtDeviceScanned_c </em>event contains additional
                    information pertaining to the extended received PDU, such as: primary PHY,
                    secondary PHY, advertising SID, interval of the periodic advertising if enabled
                    in the set.</li>

                <li class="li">Stop scanning by
                    calling:<pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t Gap_StopScanning(void);</pre>
Application
                    should wait for a gScanStateChanged_c or a gScanCommandFailed_c in the Scanning
                    Callback.</li>

                <li class="li">Connect to a device by calling:
                        <pre class="pre codeblock">bleResult_t Gap_Connect
(    
    const gapConnectionRequestParameters_t*    pParameters,    
    gapConnectionCallback_t                    connCallback
);</pre>
<p class="p">The
                            <em class="ph i">initiatingPHYs</em> parameter indicates the PHYs on which the
                        advertising packets should be received on the primary advertising channel
                        and the PHYs for which connection parameters have been specified. The
                        parameter is a bitmask of PHYs: BIT0 = LE 1M, BIT1 = LE 2M and BIT2 = LE
                        Coded. The Host may enable one or more initiating PHYs, but it must at least
                        set one bit for a PHY allowed for scanning on the primary advertising
                        channel, i.e. BIT0 for LE 1M PHY or BIT2 for LE Coded PHY.</p>
<p class="p">If the
                        advertiser uses legacy advertising PDUs, the device may connect by sending a
                        CONNECT_IND PDU to the advertiser on the LE 1M primary advertising channel
                        (no secondary channel in legacy advertising). On the other hand, if the
                        advertiser uses extended advertising PDUs, the extended connect operation
                        takes place on the secondary advertising channel. After the device receives
                        a connectable ADV_EXT_IND PDU on the primary advertising channel (PHY LE 1M
                        or Coded), it starts listening for the connectable AUX_ADV_IND PDU on the
                        secondary advertising channel (PHY 1M, 2M or Coded). Once received, the
                        device sends an AUX_CONNECT_REQ to the advertiser. Next, if AUX_CONNECT_RSP
                        PDU is received, the device enters the Connection State in the Master role
                        on the secondary advertising channel PHY. </p>
<p class="p">Application should wait for
                        a <em class="ph i">gConnEvtConnected_c</em> event in the Connection Callback. If the
                        channel selection algorithm #2 is used for this connection, then a
                            <em class="ph i">gConnEvtChanSelectionAlgorithm2_c</em> event will also be
                        generated.</p>
<p class="p">After the connection is successfully established, the
                        application may choose to read the connection PHY by calling the
                            <em class="ph i">Gap_LeReadPhy</em> API. It may also opt to change the PHY of the
                        connection by triggering a PHY Update Procedure using the
                            <em class="ph i">Gap_LeSetPhy</em> API, yet the Controller might not be able to perform
                        the change if, e.g., the peer does not support the new requested
                    PHY.</p>
