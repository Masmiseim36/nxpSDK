    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The setup requires two supported platforms, one for the adv ext peripheral, and one for the adv ext central.</p>

        <ol class="ol"><li class="li">Open a serial port terminal and connect it to each platform with the settings provided in the previous paragraph.
            The start screen is displayed after the boards are reset.

            <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 2. adv_ext_central start screen</span>

            </div>

        
        </li>

            <li class="li">On the adv_ext_peripheral board, press the WAKESW button. The board
                exits cPWR_DeepSleepMode deep sleep mode and prints the menu. <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 3. Choosing a menu option on adv_ext_peripheral</span>
                    
                    <img class="image" src="GUID-B978D556-8BC1-4983-A6F4-48D69D55A7FF-high.png"/>
                </div>

                <p class="p">Use the OPTSW to choose an option. The option printed on the bottom
                    changes every time the switch is pressed. When the option matches your intention
                    (For example, 3 Start Extended Connectable Advertising), press the WAKESW again
                    to make a decision. The advertising type chosen is started, the deep-sleep mode
                    changes to gAppDeepSleepMode_c and the board starts entering low-power between
                    advertising events. Next time the WAKESW is pressed, an updated menu is printed
                    (For example, at option 3 Stop Extended Connectable Advertising). There is no
                    timeout for advertising. The board continues advertising until it is stopped, or
                    a connection is established (for legacy and extended connectable advertising
                    only) with an adv_ext_central device. The connection is terminated five seconds
                    after the central device configures notifications for the temperature value.
                    When all advertisings are off and all connections are terminated, the deep-sleep
                    mode changes to cPWR_DeepSleepMode and the board enter low-power until the
                    WAKESW is pressed again. When cPWR_UsePowerDownMode is set 0, LEDs are enabled.
                    The ADVLED flashes whenever an advertising starts and is ON otherwise. The
                    CONNLED flashes whenever there is a connection under way and is ON
                    otherwise.</p>

            </li>

        
            <li class="li">On the adv_ext_central board, there are only two options: Press WAKESW
                to start active scanning or long press WAKESW to start passive scanning. If catching
                extended scannable advertising is not an option, choose passive scanning. Otherwise
                active scanning must be chosen. The device wakes up, starts scanning, and enters
                deep-sleep mode 6. The scanning ends when the 60 seconds timeout is reached or when
                a connection with an adv_ext_peripheral device is established. If a connection is
                established, the central changes its low-power mode to gAppDeepSleepMode_c. During
                scanning, all advertisings caught from adv_ext_peripheral devices are printed on the
                terminal window. When an extended nonconnectable, nonscannable advertising with a
                periodic advertising attached is detected, the adv_ext_central device attempts to
                sync with the periodic advertising train and prints the periodic advertising data on
                the terminal window. When the 60 seconds timer expires or the connection ends, the
                device reenters cPWR_DeepSleepMode until the WAKESW is pressed again and all syncs
                with periodic advertising trains are terminated. If cPWR_UsePowerDownMode is set 0,
                LEDs are enabled. The SCANLED flashes, whenever the device is scanning and is ON
                otherwise. The CONNLED flashes, whenever there is a connection under way and is ON
                otherwise. <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 4. Advertisings caught on adv_ext_central console</span>

                </div>

            </li>

            <li class="li">If the adv_ext_central connects to an adv_ext_peripheral device, it
                bonds (if no bond was previously made), does service discovery (only the first time
                it connects with the peripheral), configures notification and waits for
                notifications from the peripheral. If no data is sent within 5 seconds, the node
                disconnects and reenters cPWR_DeepSleepMode. The peripheral sends a notification
                with the value of the temperature read through an ADC from the thermistor, if
                present, or random generated if not. When the central receives the notification, it
                prints it on the terminal window and disconnects in 5 seconds. <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 5. Connection on adv_ext_central console</span>
