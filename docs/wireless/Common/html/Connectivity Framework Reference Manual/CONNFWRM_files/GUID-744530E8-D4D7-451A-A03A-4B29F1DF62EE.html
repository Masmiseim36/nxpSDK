    <h1 class="title topictitle1">QN908x deep sleep modes</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">QN908x has only two deep sleep modes called power down 0 (PD0) and power down 1 (PD1).
            These are described in detail in the “<a class="xref" href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/nxp/user-guides/UM11023.pdf" target="_blank">UM11023 - QN908x user manual.pdf</a>”. For both modes the needed
            RAM memory blocks are powered on (the user can configure which blocks stay powered on
            and which are powered down during deep sleep). CPU registers values can be retained
            during deep sleep (the user can also disable this feature).</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-744530E8-D4D7-451A-A03A-4B29F1DF62EE__UL_TGS_THQ_YBB">
            <li class="li">Power down 0</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">All peripheral clocks and all clock sources are switched off keeping only the 32 kHz
            clock running, RTC timer is still running. Arm CPU is in deep sleep mode, BLE controller
            is in deep sleep mode and it can wake-up the entire chip if BLE in case of BLE
            events.</p>

        <p class="p">Possible wake up sources: BLE Core, RTC, GPIO, CapSense, ACMP</p>

        <p class="p">Power down 1</p>

        <p class="p"> All peripheral clocks and all clock sources are switched off, the 32 kHz clock is also
            switched off. No timer is powered on, board can wake up only by GPIO input ( button
            press ) or analog comparator external input. </p>

        <p class="p"> Note that In this mode there is no deterministic way of waking the board up from the
            application layer. BLE core and RTC are powered down and cannot wake the chip up.</p>

        <p class="p"> Possible wake up sources: GPIO, ACMP</p>
