    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Overview</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The Timers’ Manager offers timing services with increased resolution when compared to the
            OS-based timing functions. The Timers’ Manager operates at the peripheral clock
            frequency, while the OS timer frequency is set to 200 Hz (5 ms period).</p>

        <p class="p">The following services are provided by the Timers’ Manager:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-93189D4E-E68D-4EB5-B2FD-C9EBF6D66B1B__UL_FS2_YQK_2Z">
            <li class="li"> Initialize a module</li>

            <li class="li"> Allocate a timer</li>

            <li class="li"> Free a timer</li>

            <li class="li"> Enable a timer</li>

            <li class="li"> Start a timer</li>

            <li class="li"> Stop a timer</li>

            <li class="li"> Check if a timer is active</li>

            <li class="li"> Get the remaining time until a specified timer times out</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">Two types of timers are provided as follows:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-93189D4E-E68D-4EB5-B2FD-C9EBF6D66B1B__UL_VS2_YQK_2Z">
            <li class="li"> Single Shot Timers are run only once until they time out. They can be stopped
                before the timeout.</li>

            <li class="li"> Interval Timers are run continuously and time out at the set regular intervals
                until explicitly stopped.</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">Each allocated timer has an associated callback function that is called from the
            interrupt execution context. Therefore, it must not call the blocking OS APIs. They can
            block but should never be used that way.</p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The exact time at which a callback is executed is actually greater than or equal to
            the requested value.</div>

        <p class="p">The timer resolution is 1 ms, but it is recommended to use a multiple of 4 ms because
            timeout values increase accuracy. This is due to internal integer calculation errors. </p>

        <p class="p">The implementation of the Timers Manager on Kinetis MCU-based platforms uses
            either FTM or TPM peripheral. On the QN908X platforms, the RTC free-running counter is
            used.  An interrupt is generated each
            time an allocated and running timer times out, so the mechanism is more efficient when
            compared to the OS-managed timing, which requires the execution of periodic (default is
            5 ms) interrupts.</p>

        <p class="p">Timers can be identified as low-power timers on creation. For the Kinetis
            MCU-based platforms, this doesn't mean that the low-power timers run in low-power modes.
            Instead, they are synchronized when exiting the low-power mode. If a low-power timer
            expires when the MCU sleeps, its expiration is processed when the MCU exits sleep. For
            the QN908X MCU-based platforms, the RTC timer is on during the low-power mode (except
            Power Down 1) and can generate
            interrupts. </p>

        <p class="p">The Timers’ Manager creates a task to handle the internal processing. All callbacks are
            called in context and with the priority of the timer task. As a general guideline,
            callbacks must be non-blocking and short. They must not do more than issue a
            synchronization signal. The task is set up with an above-normal priority.</p>

        <p class="p">The Timers’ Manager module also provides a timestamp functionality. This is
            implemented on top of the RTC for the Kinetis MCU-based platforms that can also use the
            PIT. In addition, it is possible to set the absolute time with a 30 milliseconds
            resolution and register an alarm event in absolute or relative time with a 1 second
            resolution. Note that there may be other framework components that use alarms, and only
            one registered alarm event at a time is permitted. The RTC section of the timer module
            requires its own initialization.</p>
