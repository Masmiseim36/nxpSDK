    <h1 class="title topictitle1">FSCI Host</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">FSCI Host is a functionality that allows separation at a certain stack layer between two
            entities, usually two boards running separate layers of a stack. </p>

        <p class="p">Support is provided for functionality at the MAC layer, for example, MAC/PHY layers of a
            stack are running as a Black Box on a board, and MAC higher layers are running on
            another. The higher layers send and receive serial commands to and from the MAC Black
            Box using the FSCI set of operation codes and groups.</p>

        <p class="p">The protocol of communication between the two is the same. The current level of support
            is provided for:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-BFA7CBFA-2ECE-49CF-82EC-85A48ECEC146__UL_V21_KKP_FZ">
            <li class="li"> FSCI_MsgResetCPUReqFunc – sends a CPU reset request to black box</li>

            <li class="li"> FSCI_MsgWriteExtendedAdrReqFunc – configures MAC extended address to the Black
                Box</li>

            <li class="li"> FSCI_MsgReadExtendedAdrReqFunc – N/A</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">The approach on the Host interfacing a Black Box using synchronous primitives is by
            default the polling of the FSCI_receivePacket function, until the response is received
            from the Black Box. The calling task polls whenever the task is being scheduled. This is
            required because a stack synchronous primitive requires that the response of that
            request is available in the context of the caller right after the SAP call has been
            executed.</p>

        <p class="p">The other option, available for RTOS environments, is using an event mechanism. The
            calling task blocks waiting for the event that is sent from the Serial Manager task when
            the response is available from the Black Box. This option is disabled by default. The
            disadvantage of this option is that the primitive cannot be received from another Black
            Box through a serial interface because the blocked task is the Serial Manager task,
            which reaches a deadlock as cannot be released again.</p>
