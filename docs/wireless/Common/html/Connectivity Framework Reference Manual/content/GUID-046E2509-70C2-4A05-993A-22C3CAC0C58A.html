    <h1 class="title topictitle1">FSCI ACK</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The FSCI provides an FSCI packet reception validation and retransmissions through an ACK
            mechanism. The ACK submodule has two components than can be enabled independent of one
            another, ACK transmission and ACK reception.</p>

        <p class="p">ACK transmission is enabled through the gFsciTxAck_c macro definition. Each FSCI valid
            packet received triggers an FSCI ACK packet transmission on the same FSCI interface that
            the packet was received on. The serial write call is performed synchronously to send the
            ACK packet before any other FSCI packet and only then the registered handler is called
            to process the received packet.</p>

        <p class="p">The ACK is represented by the gFSCI_CnfOpcodeGroup_c and mFsciMsgAck_c Opcode. An
            additional byte is left empty in the payload that can be used optionally as a packet
            identifier to correlate packets and ACKs.</p>

        <p class="p">ACK reception is the other component that is enabled through gFsciRxAck_c. The behavior
            such that every FSCI packet sent through a serial interface triggers an FSCI ACK packet
            reception on the same interface after the packet is sent. If an ACK packet is received,
            the transmission is considered successful. Otherwise, the packet is resent a number of
            times.</p>

        <p class="p">The ACK wait period is configurable through mFsciRxAckTimeoutMs_c and the number of
            transmission retries through mFsciTxRetryCnt_c.</p>

        <p class="p">The above ACK mechanism can also be coupled with a FSCI packet reception timeout enabled
            through gFsciRxTimeout_c and configurable through mFsciRxRestartTimeoutMs_c. Whenever
            there are no more bytes to be read from a serial interface, a timeout is configured at
            the predefined value should no other bytes be received. If new bytes are received, the
            timer is stopped and eventually canceled at successful reception. However, if for any
            reason the timeout is triggered, the FSCI module considers that the current packet is
            invalid, drops it and searches for a new start marker.</p>
