    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Overview</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">Most of the MCUs have only a standard flash memory that can be used by the nonvolatile
            storage system. The amount of memory that the system uses for permanent storage and its
            boundaries are defined in the linker configuration file.The reserved memory consists of
            two virtual pages. The virtual pages are equally sized and each page is using one or
            more physical flash sectors. Therefore, the smallest configuration is using two physical
            sectors, one sector per virtual page.The Flash Management and Non-Volatile Storage
            Module holds a pointer to a table where the upper layers register information about data
            that must be saved and restored by the storage system. The table contains one or more
            table entries that can be stored in RAM or in FLASH memory (default). A table entry
            contains a generic pointer to a contiguous RAM data structure, how many elements the
            structure contains, the size of a single element, a table entry ID, and an entry
            type.</p>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">pData</strong> is a pointer to the RAM memory location where the dataset elements are
                stored</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">elemCnt</strong> represents how many elements the dataset has</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">dataEntryType</strong> is a 16-bit value representing the type of entry

        </ul>

        <p class="p"> </p>

        <p class="p">The NV table is stored default in the FLASH memory and the datasets that are going to be
            managed by the NVM system may be registered by different software components/modules by
            calling the following macro:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">NVM_RegisterDataSet(pData, elementsCount, elementSize, dataEntryID, dataEntryType)</pre>

        <p class="p">Each call of the above macro will create a table entry that will be placed in the FLASH
            memory at link time. If IAR Embedded Workbench IDE is used as toolchain, then a
            dedicated section will be produced automatically at link time and all the table entries
            will be placed one after another. No supplementary changes in the linker configuration
            file (*.icf) are required. This section can be inspected in the application map file
            under the name “NVM_TABLE”. Table entries can also be observed in the map file as
            gNvmTableEntry_xxxx, where the xxxx is the datased ID number. Below there is a
            screenshot taken from a map file.</p>

        <p class="p">In the case of a GCC-based toolchain, the following symbols have to be defined in the
            linker file (*.lld): </p>

            </li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">As an example, the following code can be used:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">.NVM_TABLE :
{
    . = ALIGN(4);

    KEEP(*(.NVM_TABLE));
    PROVIDE(__stop_NVM_TABLE = .);
    . = ALIGN(4);
} &gt; TEXT_region2</pre>

        <p class="p">For mirrored datasets, pData must point directly to the RAM data. For unmirrored
            datasets, it must be a double pointer to a vector of pointers. Each pointer in this
            table points to a RAM/FLASH area.</p>

        <p class="p">Mirrored datasets require the data to be permanently kept in RAM, while unmirrored
            datasets have dataset entries either in FLASH or RAM. If the unmirrored entries must be
            restored at the initialization, NotMirroredInRamAutoRestore should be used. Unmirrored
            entries must be enabled by the application by setting gUnmirroredFeatureSet_d to 1.</p>

        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">pData:</strong></p>

        <img class="image" src="GUID-857E6677-8ED4-4BA5-8902-21A15269D405-high.png"/>
        <p class="p">When the data pointed to by the table entry pointer (pData) has changed (entirely or just
            a single element), the upper layers call the appropriate API function that requests the
            storage system to save the modified data. All the save operations (except for the
            synchronous save and atomic save) and the page erase and page copy operations are
            performed on system idle task. The application must create a task that calls NvIdle in
            an infinite loop. It should be created with OSA_PRIORITY_IDLE. However, the application
            may choose another priority.</p>

        <p class="p">The saves are done in one virtual page, which is the active page. After a save is
            performed on an unmirrored dataset, pData points to a flash location and the RAM pointer
            is freed. As a result, the effective data should always be allocated using the memory
            management module. </p>

        <p class="p">The active page contains information about the records and the records themselves. The
            storage system can save individual elements of a table entry or the entire table entry.
            Unmirrored datasets can only have individual saves.</p>

        <p class="p">On mirrored datasets, the save/restore functions must receive the pointer to RAM data.
            For example, if the application must save the third element in the above vector, it
            should send 0x1FFF8000 + 2 * elemSz.</p>

        <p class="p">For unmirrored datasets, the application must send the pointer that points to the area
            where the data is located. For example, if the application must save the third element
            in the above vector, it should send 0x1FFF8000 + 2 * sizeof(void*).</p>

        <p class="p">The page validity is guaranteed by the page counter. The page counter is a 32/64-bit
            value and it is written at the beginning and at the end of the active page. The values
            need to be equal to consider the page a valid one. The value of the page counter is
            incremented after each page copy operation. A page erase operation is performed when the
            system is formatted or every time a page is full and a new record cannot be written into
            that page. Before being erased, the full page is first copied (only the most recent
            saves, i.e. defragmentation) and erased afterwards.</p>

        <p class="p">The validity of the Meta Information Tag (MIT), and, therefore, of a record, is
            guaranteed by the MIT start and stop validation bytes. These two bytes must be equal to
            consider the record referred by the MIT valid. Furthermore, the value of these bytes
            indicates the type of the record, whether it is a single element or an entire table
            entry. </p>

        <p class="p">If the NV table is stored in RAM, the nonvolatile storage system allows dynamic changes
            of the table entries, as follows:</p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Remove table entry</li>

            <li class="li">Register table entry</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">If the NV table is stored in FLASH (default) the above operation are not allowed. A new
            table entry can be successfully registered if there is at least one entry previously
            removed or if the NV table contains uninitialized table entries, declared explicitly to
            register new table entries at runtime. A new table entry can also replace an existing
            one if the register table entry is called with an overwrite set to true. This
            functionality is disabled by default and must be enabled by the application by setting
            gNvUseExtendedFeatureSet_d to 1.</p>

        <p class="p">The layout of an active page is shown below:</p>

        <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 3. The layout of a flash active page</span>
            
            <img class="image" src="GUID-213A324F-EB66-4AA6-B50F-AD38DB6BF09B-high.png"/>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Only the first 4 bytes are used to store the page counter value, the remaining bytes
            are set to 0x00 in order to keep the compatibility with legacy formats.</div>

        <p class="p">As shown above, the table stored in the RAM/FLASH memory is copied into the FLASH active
            page, just after the table version. The “NV TABLE COPY” is framed by the table markers.
            The data pointers from RAM are not copied. A flash copy of a table entry has the
            following structure:</p>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">elemSz</strong> is the size of a single element</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">This copy of the NV table is used to determine whether the current NV table has
            changed.</p>

        <p class="p">The table marker has a value of 0x4254 (“TB” if read as ASCII codes) and marks the
            beginning and end of the NV table copy.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="p">After the end of the NV table copy, the Meta Information Tags (MITs) follow. Each MIT is
            used to store information related to one record. An MIT has the following structure:</p>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">elemIdx</strong> is the element index</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">recordOffset</strong> is the offset of the record related to the start address of the

        </ul>

        <p class="p">A valid MIT has a VSB equal to a VEB. If the MIT refers to a single-element record type,
                <strong class="ph b">VSB=VEB=0xAA</strong>. If the MIT refers to a full table entry record type (all
            elements from a table entry), <strong class="ph b">VSB=VEB=0x55</strong>.</p>

        <p class="p">Because the records are written to the flash page, the available page space decreases. As
            a result, the page becomes full and a new record does not have enough free space to be
            copied into that page. In the example given below, the virtual page 1 is considered to
            be full if a new save request is pending and the page free space is not sufficient to
            copy the new record and the additional MIT. In this case, the latest saved datasets
            (table entries) are copied to virtual page 2. </p>

        <p class="p">In the following example, there are five datasets (one color for each dataset) with both
            ‘full’ and ‘single’ record types.</p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">R1</strong> is a ‘full’ record type (contains all the NV table entry elements),
                whereas <strong class="ph b">R3</strong>, <strong class="ph b">R4</strong>, <strong class="ph b">R6 </strong>and <strong class="ph b">R11</strong> are ‘single’ record
                types.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">R2</strong> – full record type; <strong class="ph b">R15</strong> – single record type</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">R5</strong>, R<strong class="ph b">13</strong> – full record type; <strong class="ph b">R10</strong>, R<strong class="ph b">12</strong> – single record
                type</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">R8</strong> – full record type</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">R7</strong>, <strong class="ph b">R9</strong>, <strong class="ph b">R14</strong>, <strong class="ph b">R16</strong> – full record type</li>

        </ul>

        <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 7. Virtual page 1 free space is not large enough for saving a new dataset</span>
            
            <img class="image" src="GUID-DA9DC356-463E-4F05-AA06-0DBE95617EE4-high.png"/>
        </div>

        <p class="p">As shown above, the <strong class="ph b">R3</strong>, <strong class="ph b">R4</strong>, <strong class="ph b">R6</strong>, and <strong class="ph b">R11</strong> are ‘single’ record
            types, while <strong class="ph b">R1</strong> is a ‘full’ record type of the same dataset. When copied to
            virtual page 2, a defragmentation process takes place. As a result, the record copied to
            virtual page 2 has as much elements as <strong class="ph b">R1</strong>, but individual elements are taken from
                <strong class="ph b">R3</strong>,<strong class="ph b"> R4</strong>, <strong class="ph b">R6</strong>, and <strong class="ph b">R11</strong>. After the copy process completes,
            the virtual page 2 has five ‘full’ record types, one for each dataset.</p>

        <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 8. Page copy</span>

        </div>

        <p class="p">Finally, the virtual page 2 is validated by writing the PC value and a request to erase
            virtual page 1 is performed. The page is erased on an idle task, sector by sector where
            only one sector is erased at a time when idle task is executed.</p>

        <p class="p">If there are any difference between the RAM and flash tables, the application must call
            RecoverNvEntry for each entry that is different from its RAM copy to recover the entry
            data (ID, Type, ElemSz, ElemCnt) from flash before calling NvInit. The application must
            allocate the pData and change the RAM entry. It can choose to ignore the flash entry if
            the entry is not desired. If any entry from RAM differs from its flash equivalent at
            initialization, a page copy is triggered that ignores the entries that are different. In
            other words, data stored in those entries will be lost. </p>

        <p class="p">The application can check if the NVM table was updated, in other words, if the MCU
            program was changed and the NVM table was updated, using the function
            GetFlashTableVersion and compare the result with the constant gNvFlashTableVersion_c. If
            the versions are different, NvInit detects the update and automatically upgrades the
            flash table. The upgrade process triggers a page copy that moves the flash data from the
            active page to the other one. It keeps the entries that were not modified intact and it
            moves the entries that had their elements count changed as follows:</p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">If the RAM element count is smaller than the flash element count, the upgrade only
                copies as much elements as are in RAM</li>

            <li class="li">If the RAM element count is larger than the flash element count, the upgrade copies
                all data from flash and fills the remaining space with data from RAM</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">If the entry size is changed, the entry is not copied. Any entryIds that are present in
            flash and not present in RAM are also not copied.</p>

        <p class="p">This functionality is not supported if gNvUseExtendedFeatureSet_d is not set to 1.</p>
