    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Deep sleep mode 1</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">This low-power mode was designed to be used when the BLE stack is active.</p>

        <p class="p">In this mode, the MCU enters LLS3 and BLE Link Layer enters deep sleep. The SoC wakes up
            from this mode by the on-board switches, by LPTMR timeout, or by BLE Link Layer wakeup
            interrupt (BLE_LL reference clock reaches wake up instance register) using LLWU module.
            The LPTMR timer is used to measure the time that the MCU spends in deep sleep to
            synchronize low-power timers at wakeup. There are two ways to use this mode:</p>

        <ol class="ol" id="GUID-5937F502-C753-4CF5-8B86-0312E09007C5__OL_ZNW_XHW_FZ">
            <li class="li"> The BLE stack decides it can enter low-power and calls PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep(). If
                no other software entity prevents the system from entering deep sleep (all software
                layers that called PWR_DisallowDeviceToSleep() have called back
                PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep()) and the system reaches idle task, PWR_EnterLowPower
                function is entered and the system prepares for entering low-power mode 1. The BLE
                Link layer status is checked and found not to be in deep sleep. A function from BLE
                stack is called to get the nearest instant at which the BLE Link layer needs to be
                running again and the wakeup instant register in the BLE Link layer is programmed
                with this value. The BLE link layer is then put in deep sleep and the MCU enters
                LLS3. </li>

            <li class="li"> The BLE stack decides it can enter low-power and calls
                PWR_BLE_EnterDSM(wakeupInstant) followed by PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep(). In this way,
                the BLE Link layer is put to deep sleep immediately, the MCU remaining to enter LLS3
                on idle task. If no other software entity prevents the system from entering deep
                sleep (all software layers that called PWR_DisallowDeviceToSleep() have called back
                PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep()) and the system reaches idle task, PWR_EnterLowPower
                function is entered and the system prepares to complete entering low-power mode 1.
                The BLE Link layer status is checked and found to be in deep sleep, so the MCU puts
                itself in LLS3 and deep sleep mode 1 is finally reached. </li>

        </ol>

        <p class="p">With a timeout calculated as cPWR_BLE_LL_OscStartupDelay +
            cPWR_BLE_LL_OffsetToWakeupInstant before BLE link layer reference clock register reaches
            the value in wakeup register, the BLE Link Layer wakes up the entire SoC and the system
            resumes its activity. The two defines above can be found in the PWR_Configuration.h
            header file.</p>
