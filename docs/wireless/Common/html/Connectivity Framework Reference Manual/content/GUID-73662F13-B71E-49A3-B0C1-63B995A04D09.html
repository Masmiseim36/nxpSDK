    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The DCDC converter module is a switching mode DC-DC converter supporting Buck, Boost, and
            Bypass modes. The DCDC converter produces two switching outputs in both the Buck and
            Boost modes. They are VDD1p45 (KW40Z)/VDD1p5 (KW41Z) (referred to as VDDMCU) and VDD1p8,
            which can produce up to 25 mA and 42.5 mA continuous output current respectively. </p>

        <p class="p">In Buck mode, it supports operation with battery voltage from 2.1 V to 4.2 V. </p>

        <p class="p">In Boost mode, it supports operation with battery voltage from 0.9 V to 1.8 V. </p>

        <p class="p">In Bypass mode, the DCDC converter is disabled. Individual supply signals of KW4xZ need
            to be supplied with regulated supply accordingly.</p>

        <p class="p">The DCDC operating mode is hardware selected through configuration jumpers.</p>

        <p class="p">The DCDC driver purpose is to ensure that the DCDC operates properly.</p>

        <p class="p">At DCDC driver initialization (DCDC_Init), the user passes DCDC operating parameters to
            the driver. The operating parameters are battery voltage range, DCDC operating mode, the
            time interval in milliseconds, at which the driver should monitor and improve DCDC
            functionality, a callback to notify the application about the DCDC status, and the
            desired output targets of the DCDC power lines. </p>

        <p class="p">If the chosen DCDC operating mode is Bypass mode, the driver takes no further action.
            Otherwise, the driver starts a low-power interval timer (the timer interval is the one
            received in the configuration structure at DCDC_Init) to monitor and improve DCDC
            operation periodically. Each time the low-power timer expires, the driver measures the
            battery voltage using ADC driver and sets its value in DCDC hardware, determines the
            output targets for the power lines depending on the battery voltage and user desired
            values, sets these values in the appropriate registers and then calls the application
            callback to notify the user about the DCDC status. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, letâ€™s suppose the DCDC operates in Boost mode, the measured battery voltage
            is 1.5 V and the output target values requested by the user are 1.8 V for the VDD1p8
            power line and 1.45 V for the VDDMCU power line. The output target values determined by
            the driver are 1.8 V for the 1.8 V power line and 1.55 V for the VDDMCU power line since
            in Boost mode the output voltages must be at least 50 mV above the battery voltage.</p>
