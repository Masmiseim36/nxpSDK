    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">A memory management module, which is organized into partitions of identical memory
            blocks, is included in the framework. Every block of memory has a header used by the
            memory manager for internal bookkeeping. This header is reused in the message system to
            avoid further overhead. As a result, the message component can only use the buffers
            allocated with the memory manager.</p>

        <p class="p">The framework also includes a general-purpose linked lists module, which is used in
            several other components. The message system takes advantage of linked lists, using the
            memory managerâ€™s header space to provide an overhead-free unlimited size queue system.
            The user must allocate a message buffer and pass it to the message system without
            worrying about the extra space required by the linked list element header or the maximum
            size of the queue. The only limitation is the amount of memory available to the memory
            manager.</p>

        <p class="p">Although this approach is efficient in terms of memory space and unbound by a maximum
            queue size, it does not provide the means to synchronize tasks. Semaphores, mutexes,
            signals, and so on, are provided for this purpose. It is recommended to use the existing
            signals because they are created for every task and to avoid consuming extra memory. </p>

        <p class="p">The user can send a message to a receiving task and then activate the synchronization
            element. The message is dequeued after waiting for the synchronization signal. The
            actual memory buffer is allocated by the sending task and must be freed or reused by the
            receiving task. In terms of memory space, this approach requires only an additional
            linked list anchor. </p>

        <p class="p">The messaging module is a blend of macros and functions on top of the Memory Manager and
            List modules.</p>
