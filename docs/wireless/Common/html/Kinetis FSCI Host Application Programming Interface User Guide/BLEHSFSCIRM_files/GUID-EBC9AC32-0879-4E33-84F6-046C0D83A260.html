    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Userspace module in TAP mode and global addressing scheme</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">One can use either hsdk/demo/Thread_KW_Tun.c with SERIAL_TAP defined on 1 or
            hsdk/demo/Thread_Shell.c. The latter is preferred because it simulates a user-friendly
            shell over FSCI interface that resembles the one present in the router_eligible_device
            projects, plus features designed to re-establish communication after a power
            failure/reset.</p>

        <p class="p">hsdk/demo/make_tap.sh can be used to create a virtual TAP interface named
            threadtap0, like in the previous chapter. Thread_Shell has only two arguments: the
            device node and 802.15.4 channel to be used; it automatically opens the threadtap0
            interface. Example of usage: </p>

        <p class="p"># ./Thread_Shell /dev/ttyACM0 25</p>

        <p class="p">In case make_tap.sh is not used, the user is requested to create a TAP interface manually
            and update the TAP_IFNAME symbol in Thread_Shell.c to the new tunnel interface name. </p>

        <p class="p">This section shows how to test external IPv6 connectivity through the Thread
            border router device which is provisioned an external IPv6 prefix by an external OpenWrt
            based device, when ND host mode is enabled. The application acts as a Border Router with
            respect to propagating the network provisioning information to the downstream Thread
            network (such as IPv6 address assignment based on prefix delegation) and interfacing
            end-to-end IP layer connectivity to the Thread-only nodes.</p>

        <p class="p">To run the application use case, the board must be connected to a Linux box
            that is itself connected to a router or switch which provides IPv6 prefix provisioning
            by means of DHCPv6-PD (Prefix Delegation) and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ND). The
            TAP interface must be bridged with the uplink interface towards the DHCPv6-PD capable
            OpenWrt router. Assuming eth0 is the name of the uplink interface and threadtap0 is the
            name of the TAP interface, the following commands are needed on the Linux box to bridge
            the Thread TAP and uplink interfaces: </p>

        <div class="p"><pre class="pre codeblock"># brctl addbr br0 
# brctl addif br0 eth0 
# brctl addif br0 threadtap0           </pre>
 </div>

        <p class="p">Starting Thread_Shell enables the IPv6 traffic flow between the OpenWrt router and the
            Thread border router. </p>

        <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Topology</span><img class="image" src="GUID-0C68BFCA-F330-47C3-AE84-7ADFC0913E87-high.png"/></div>

        <p class="p">When the Thread stack is started, either when a new network is created or an existing one
            joined to, the border router tries to acquire global addresses via DHCPv6-PD. For this
            operation to succeed, the OpenWrt router must implement RFC3633 and must be configured
            with a /48 ULA prefix. If the request is successful, a /64 prefix sub-range from the /48
            ULA prefix range will be assigned to the border router, for it to distribute into the
            Thread network. A global address will be configured to the 6LoWPAN interface of the
            border router and to other existing devices in the Thread network or newly joined ones.
            Communication that uses this global ULA-based addressing scheme will work with no other
            added static routes, i.e. the Thread end nodes are accessible from the LAN hosts and
            vice-versa. </p>

        <p class="p">Thread_Shell is also capable of detecting link changes on the bridged
            interface (eth0), useful for situations where the OpenWrt router resets. Make sure to
            define UPLINK_IFNAME to the appropriate uplink interface name in Linux. In the unlikely
            event of a router reset, Thread_Shell notifies the Thread border router to re-establish
            the communication with the router, by means of a new DHCPv6-PD request.</p>
