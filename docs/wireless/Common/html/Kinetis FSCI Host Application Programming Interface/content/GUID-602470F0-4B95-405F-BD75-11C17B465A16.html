  <h1 class="title topictitle1">External commissioning of untrusted Thread radio devices</h1>

  
  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"/>

    <p class="p">Terms such as Border Router, Commissioner, Joiner, Joiner Router, and MeshCoP
      appear in this chapter. See Thread 1.1, Specification for an in-depth overview of the
      commissioning protocol used in Thread networks.</p>

    <p class="p">A Border Router, as defined by the Thread specification, is a device capable of forwarding packets between a Thread Network and a non-Thread Network where the Commissioner is reachable. NXP offers two solutions for a Border Router:</p>

    <ol class="ol">
      <li class="li">NXP FRDM-K64F – interface to Commissioner over physical Ethernet interface.</li>

      <li class="li">NXP KW2xD/KW41Z – any form-factor – connected to a physical or virtual Linux OS machine which provides various means of interfacing with the Commissioner, depending on the capabilities: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Virtual Machine Software Adapter, and so on.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="p">This chapter focuses on the second Border Router solution because it is tightly
      coupled with the Host API solution over a TAP interface described throughout this document. </p>

    <p class="p">The Thread Group provides an Android application that acts as an external Commissioner over
      Wi-Fi for the Thread network. Install Thread 1.1 Commissioning App from Google Play Store
      prior to starting the setup.</p>

    <p class="p">The following steps are required to establish a MeshCoP channel between the Android
      smartphone and the Thread Border Router:</p>

    <div class="p">
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Bridge the TAP and uplink interfaces as described in chapter 6.3 "Userspace module and
          global addressing scheme". Then run Thread_Shell to enable the IPv6 traffic flow between
          the LAN hosts and the Thread border router and create/join a Thread network: 
          <pre class="pre codeblock">#./bin/Thread_Shell /dev/ttyACM0 25 
            &gt; thr create 
            [... output elided ...]</pre>
</li>

        
        <li class="li">Connect the Android smartphone to the LAN</li>

        <li class="li"> Open Thread 1.1 Commissioning App. A "BorderRouter THREAD" entry should be available
          under "AVAILABLE BORDER ROUTERS". Click on it and enter "THREAD" as the Thread Admin
          Password. "THREAD" is the Border Router device password (PSKd) and it is configured by
          Thread_Shell on network creation. After a few seconds the MeshCoP connection is
          established and Thread_Shell will print out the following messages as an indication:
          <pre class="pre codeblock">RX: THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner-&gt;BR Accepted
RX: THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner petition alert </pre>

          If the application does not detect any available border routers, please check the network
          settings and disable firewall rules that may be filtering out mDNS traffic.</li>

        <li class="li"><p class="p">Prepare a Joiner device to be added to the network. For simplicity let us assume this
            device is running the router_eligible_device project. Make sure both the Border Router
            and Joiner operate on the same 802.15.4 channel. Open Joiner's shell console to retrieve
            its IEEE EUI-64 address and get or set the PSKd:</p>
<p class="p">$ thr get eui eui:
            0x006037831472D1BA </p>
<p class="p">$ thr get pskd pskd: THREAD </p>
<p class="p">If you plan to change the
            password, please be advised that the PSKd must respect the following format, according
            to the Thread 1.1 Specification: "A Joining Device Credential is encoded as uppercase
            alphanumeric characters (base32-thread: 0-9,A-Y excluding I,O,Q, and Z for readability)
            with a minimum length of 6 such characters and a maximum length of 32 such
            characters."</p>
 Create a QR code of type Text from text
          "v=1&amp;cc=THREAD&amp;eui=006037831472D1BA". Please note that the EUI must not contain
          the "0x" prefix. Continue and scan this QR code from the Android app and then issue `thr
          join` in Joiner's shell. The Android user interface will confirm if the Joiner was
          successfully added, while Thread_Shell will print out the following indications:
          <pre class="pre codeblock">RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner&lt;-Joiner Outbound Data Relayed 
RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner-&gt;Joiner Inbound Data Relayed 
RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner&lt;-Joiner Outbound Data Relayed 
RX: THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner-&gt;Joiner Inbound Data Relayed 
RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner&lt;-Joiner Outbound Data Relayed 
RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner-&gt;Joiner Inbound Data Relayed 
RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner&lt;-Joiner Outbound Data Relayed 
RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner-&gt;Joiner Inbound Data Relayed 
RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner&lt;-Joiner Outbound Data Relayed 
RX:THR_CommissioningDiagnostic.Indication -&gt; OUT JOIN_ENT_REQ 
RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Providing the security material to the Joiner 
RX:THR_EventNwkCommissioning.Indication -&gt; Commissioner-&gt;Joiner Inbound Data Relayed 
RX:THR_CommissioningDiagnostic.Indication -&gt; IN JOIN_ENT_RSP       </pre>

          The Joiner is now connected to the Thread network and other devices can be added in the
          same manner. </li>

        
      </ul>
