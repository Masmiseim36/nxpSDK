    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Factory default state</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p"/>

        <p class="p">The first time an application runs after its firmware had been deployed to a
            device is in a factory default idle state where it is not connected to any network. For
            the examples deployed on standard development boards, this is indicated by RGB LED
            flashing blue and red LED flashing also.</p>

        <p class="p">From the Thread network perspective, when initially in Factory Default state or if reset
            to this state, the node radio is off and the device is off any Thread network.</p>

        <p class="p">In order to bring a Factory Default state device onto an active Thread network,
            applications can opt for one of the following:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-42A2B50E-7521-4839-A71D-1B73A8DCC6B0__UL_XH2_5KN_HZ">
            <li class="li">If the application has been configured at compile time to include
                routing capability, the application can opt to <strong class="ph b">create a new Thread network</strong>
                entity and the current node can act as its initial Leader router. In order to create
                a new Thread network, the application must call <strong class="ph b">THR_NwkCreate</strong> API. This API
                along with the rest of network state commands are defined in API interface header <strong class="ph b">\middleware\wireless\nwk_ip_1.2.8\core\interface\thread\ thread_network.h</strong>.The application can also opt to establish the configuration
                setting for the network either at compile time, or dynamically.</li>

            <li class="li">Otherwise, the application can choose to scan for networks to join
                created by other nodes using the <strong class="ph b">THR_NwkJoin</strong> API. If joining a network
                instead of creating one, the application can set certain parameters, including
                whether the security credentials of the network are obtained by the DTLS in-band
                commissioning or whether the credentials are configured statically for testing or
                having been obtained out-of-band. <strong class="ph b">THR_NwkJoin </strong>triggers commissioning or
                attached depending on the value of the iscommissioned attribute. It can be set to 0
                (pre-commissioned, commissioned out-of-band, the node only attaches to a scanned
                network) or 1 (not pre-commissioned, the node perform in-band commissioning using
                DTLS).</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">Before joining, applications can also opt to set parameters dynamically by
            means of the THR_SetAttr API and do standalone scanning for networks using the
            THR_NwkScanWithBeacon or THR_NwkDiscoveryReq API.</p>
