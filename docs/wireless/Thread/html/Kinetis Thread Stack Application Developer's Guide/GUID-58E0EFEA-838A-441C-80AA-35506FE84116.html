    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Starting and configuring the commissioner module</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">A Commissioner for a Thread network is a management network module and IP protocol
            end-point which is used to allow new devices to join Thread networks and optionally
            perform other management tasks. A Commissioner module does not necessarily have be
            deployed to a device having a Thread interface. The Mesh Commissioning protocol allows
            commissioners in the home Local Area Network (LAN) to interact with Thread networks
            through a Border Router in order to fulfill the commissioner role. </p>

        <p class="p">The Kinetis Thread Stack provides a full Mesh Commissioning Protocol API allowing devices
            to also start and operate an interior network Commissioner.</p>

        <p class="p">The example applications by default start a commissioner module on a Thread partition
            Leader with a default provisioning of security to allow all devices having PSKd ‘THREAD’
            to join. This is done by calling the <strong class="ph b">MESHCOP_StartCommissioner</strong> API when the
            device transitions to a Leader role, which can take place at the creation of a new
            Thread network or when a network is partitioned and the Leader role is taken by another
            Active Router of the partition.</p>

        <p class="p">To activate the commissioner module on any device, the application must call:</p>

        <div class="p"><pre class="pre codeblock">MESHCOP_StartCommissioner(thrInstanceId);</pre>
</div>

        <p class="p"/>

        <p class="p">The effect of the Start Commissioner call is that the Thread device petitions the
            partition Leader to be accepted as a Commissioner. If the Leader role is active on the
            same device (Leader and Commissioner roles are collapsed on the same node), then the
            petitioning is auto-accepted locally, otherwise a petitioning message is sent through
            the Thread network between the Commissioner and the Leader.</p>

        <p class="p">The Leader responds to the petitioning by allowing or rejecting it. On the Commissioner
            device, this is indicated to the application using the
                <strong class="ph b">gThrEv_MeshCop_CommissionerPetitionAccepted_c</strong> and
                <strong class="ph b">gThrEv_MeshCop_CommissionerPetitionRejected_c</strong> event messages.</p>

        <p class="p">Before users initiate joining a new device to a network, the commissioner should be
            configured specifically to allow the specific device to join. The identifiers for the
            device are its Thread interface IEEE EUI64 and the device password (PSKd). In order for
            the Commissioner module to allow a specific device to join, the EUI64 and the PSKd must
            be added to the Commissioner allowed joiner List:</p>

        <p class="p">To add a new Joiner to the allowed joiner list, the application must call:</p>

        <div class="p"><pre class="pre codeblock">MESHCOP_AddExpectedJoiner(mThrInstanceId, aEui, aPSKd, sizeOfPSKdInBytes, TRUE)</pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">MESHCOP_RemoveAllExpectedJoiners</strong>, <strong class="ph b">MESHCOP_RemoveExpectedJoiner</strong>,
                <strong class="ph b">MESHCOP_GetExpectedJoiner</strong> APIs as defined in header file
            nwk_ip\core\interface\thread\thread_meshcop.h may be used to further manipulate the
            current expected joiner list which is stored by the Commissioner module.</p>

        <p class="p">The Expected Joiner list APIs are only processed internally and do not have network
            effects of steering new devices to join before the steering information is synchronized
            to the Active Routers. To disseminate and synchronize expected joiner information to the
            Thread network Active Routers (including the router entity on the local device of the
            Commissioner) the application must call:</p>

        <div class="p"><pre class="pre codeblock">MESHCOP_SyncSteeringData(mThrInstanceId, gMeshcopEuiMaskExpectedJoinerList_c)</pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">MESHCOP_SyncSteeringData</strong> API can also be called with the flags
                <strong class="ph b">gMeshcopEuiMaskAllFFs_c</strong> to not filter the EUI64 and steer all devices for the
            respective network or alternatively to <strong class="ph b">gMeshcopEuiMaskAllZeroes_c</strong> to deny all
            devices (the Commissioner “closes” the network for joining).</p>

        <p class="p"> </p>

        <p class="p">Active commissioner applications are strongly recommended to explicitly close the network
            for joining in most cases once the commissioning session is over by calling:</p>

        <div class="p"><pre class="pre codeblock">MESHCOP_SyncSteeringData(mThrInstanceId, gMeshcopEuiMaskAllZeroes_c)</pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">To deactivate the commissioner, the application must call:</p>

        <div class="p"><pre class="pre codeblock">MESHCOP_StopCommissioner(mThrInstanceId)</pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">This stops the keep alive messages sent from the Commissioner to the Leader, sends keep alive with reject and frees resources taken up by the commissioner.</p>
