    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Example Applications</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The Thread stack is provided along with IAR® Embedded Workbench and MCUXpresso example applications, which are useful starting points for application developers before they modify and enhance. The example application are templates for the main categories of Thread devices:</p>

        <p class="p"/>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-9167CB2E-4DEB-4ACD-A88F-B8AADD94A80B__UL_RDF_ZFL_HZ">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Router Eligible Device</strong> – a standalone Thread wireless node which has mesh routing
                capabilities and also can act as a Parent, forwarding, buffering data and
                accomplishing network management functionality on behalf of attached child End
                Devices</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">End Device</strong> – a standalone Thread wireless node which is always powered on with radio
                receiving, however may not have on-board resources to buffer and forward routed data
                in the wireless mesh or by acting as a Parent</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Low Power End Device</strong> – is an application template similar to the
                End Device with the distinguishing characteristic that the device is preconfigured
                to have both the microcontroller in low power state and the radio turned off for
                most of the device life cycle; the device “wakes up” periodically at a few seconds
                interval and actively polls its Parent Router for data addressed to it or optionally
                initiates sending data to the network by means of the Parent Router</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Border Router</strong> – when deployed, the IP stack is enabled to forward messages
                between the Thread IEEE® 802.15.4/6LoWPAN wireless mesh interface to the auxiliary
                interface, over the Thread network border; messages can thus reach upstream
                infrastructure, such as a standard home Local Area Network (LAN) or the Internet and
                cloud servers</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Host Controlled Device</strong> – an application implementing an expansive full
                featured, Router capable configuration of the stack in conjunction with activating a
                UART/SPI/USB peripheral which carries over the Thread Host Control Interface (THCI)
                protocol frames in order to facilitate scenarios where the Thread stack
                microcontroller is driven by a host application processor or a tool</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">The application share a similar high-level toolchain project structure being
            differentiated by the starting point application file and stack and system
            configuration.</p>

        <p class="p">For more details on the example applications, see the <em class="ph i">Kinetis Thread Stack Demo
                Applications User’s Guide</em> (document KTSDAUG).</p>
