    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Overview</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">This scenario shows how to visualize the Thread network states of
                <strong class="ph b">partition creation</strong> and <strong class="ph b">partition</strong>
            <strong class="ph b">merging</strong> using the board LEDs.</p>

        <p class="p">A Thread routing segment is a group of Routers and their associated children
            End Devices which can reach each other on direct radio links or via a multihop path
            (through messages forwarded through a set of other routers in the segment).</p>

        <p class="p">When two or more routing segments of a Thread network become disconnected -
            for instance due to nodes being moved out of range or intermediary routers being turned
            off - then each routing segment creates a distinct network partition having its own
            Leader node.</p>

        <p class="p">When Routers detect loss of connectivity to the current Leader node due to
            that being in a different network partition, they advertise their state and a new Router
            in the current routing segment emerges as a Leader of the new network partition which
            got disconnected from the segment containing the previous Leader.</p>

        <p class="p">In a worst case scenario, even a single Router can be part of a distinct
            network partition.</p>

        <p class="p">When Routers in distinct partitions come back into connectivity range, their
            respective partitions merge back into a common partition having a single Leader.</p>
