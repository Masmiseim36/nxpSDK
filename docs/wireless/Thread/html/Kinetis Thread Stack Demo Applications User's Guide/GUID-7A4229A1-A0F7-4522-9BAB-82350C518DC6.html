    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The Low-power End Device (also called Sleepy End Device (SED)) is an End Device which is
            meant to remain in a low-power, dormant state for the majority of its lifetime. It is
            usually battery-powered with a limited battery capacity. </p>

        <p class="p">The Low-power End Device in most use cases becomes active for communication only for very
            short periods, either “waking up” automatically based on a predefined periodic timer or
            by means of user interaction. </p>

        <p class="p">The device can become active, for example when a user presses a button and generates a
            wake up interrupt. As soon as they become active, Low-power End Devices can poll their
            parent Active Router for any data addressed to them and transmit any outgoing data they
            have to send. The devices should return as quickly as it is allowed by the application
            to the previous inactive radio state to preserve their battery. </p>

        <p class="p">Other devices communicating with a Low-power End Device must assume there may be some
            latency when sending data towards the end device. On the other hand, an interrupt-based
            wake up and associated transmissions which originate from the Low-power End Device can
            be very quick. These devices make good candidates for light switches, remote controls,
            or sensors.</p>
