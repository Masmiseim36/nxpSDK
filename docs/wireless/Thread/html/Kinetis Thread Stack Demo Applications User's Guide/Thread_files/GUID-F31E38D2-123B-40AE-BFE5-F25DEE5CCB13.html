    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Thread router eligible devices</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">A Router Eligible Device is a node which initially joins the network as an End Device,
            but can adaptively become a mesh Router. Such a device may also have capabilities to
            initialize, create, and bootstrap a new Thread Network for the user or a management
            entity.</p>

        <p class="p">The distinct roles this device can play during network operation are: </p>

        <ul class="ul" id="GUID-F31E38D2-123B-40AE-BFE5-F25DEE5CCB13__UL_CMD_3VC_GZ">
            <li class="li">Router Eligible End Device(REED)</li>

            <li class="li">Active Router, also referred to as a Promoted Router, or a Router</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">The two roles are dynamic and can adaptively change from the End Device role when the
            node does not actively participate in routing, does not forward data transmissions, and
            cannot accept to be a “parent” for other End Devices to the Active Router role which
            actively performs all these functionalities.</p>

        <p class="p">Typically up to 16-32 Router Eligible Devices on a Thread Network can automatically
            activate the routing functionality and request a Router Identifier (Router ID). When a
            Router ID is assigned, the devices become Active Routers. </p>

        <p class="p">A Router Eligible Device can also assume a Leader role, acting as a point of decision for
            Router ID assignments and dissemination of routing and network information for a network
            partition. A Thread network starts as a single network partition. However, multiple
            distinct partitions can form if routing segments of the same network become
            disconnected. The partitions are still part of the same Thread network, and can share
            network credentials and merge back to a single partition if inter-connectivity between
            the routing segments is re-established. Each partition has a single Leader router. The
            Leader role is transitional and can be taken over by any other Active Router in the
            partition if the current Leader becomes unavailable.</p>

        <p class="p">The application example for a Router Eligible Device is a template for developing
            mains-powered and always-on Thread devices such as smart power outlets, appliances,
            network range extenders, and control panels.</p>

        <p class="p">Other mains-powered devices such as smart light bulbs or lamps are not restricted by
            power constraints and can act as routers. However, because users can disconnect power
            from light bulbs using room power switches, the network routing capacity can become
            diminished when onlylighting fixtures act as routers. </p>

        <p class="p">When deploying Thread devices and networks, a base routing infrastructure consisting of
            always-on Router Eligible Devices is recommended.</p>
