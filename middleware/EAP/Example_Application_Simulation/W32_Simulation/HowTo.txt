Goal: Be able to process input audio file on your PC without any hardware

How:
 1- Create your own audio input file, read W32_Simulation\In\WhereAreInputFiles.txt.
 2- Run W32_Simulation\TalArgsTest\RunAllTest.bat
    => It copy W32_Simulation\release\EAP_Simulator_X.exe to W32_Simulation\EAP_TestParam.exe
    => It run all the pre-configured configuration located in W32_Simulation\TalArgsTest
 3- Modify W32_Simulation\Tal_args.txt to update EAP configuration
 4- Re-launch W32_Simulation\EAP_TestParam.exe
