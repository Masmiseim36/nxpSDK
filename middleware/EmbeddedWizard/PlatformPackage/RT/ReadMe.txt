Platform Specific Release Notes (Version History of GFX and RTE):
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  Please read first the Embedded Wizard Release Notes, to be informed about all
  general improvements or changes:

  https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/release-notes

  The following section contains additonal platform specific changes, related to
  Graphics Engine (GFX) or Runtime Environment (RTE):

* Version 9.20
  - The Graphics Engines for color format RGBA8888, RGB888 and RGB565 have
    been enhanced to support the new bitmap resource formats RGB565 and Index8.
  - The support for the new bitmap resource format RGB565 can be excluded from
    the Graphics Engine code by using the new define EW_DONT_USE_RGB565_SURFACES.
  - The support for the new bitmap resource format Index8 can be excluded from
    the Graphics Engine code by using the new define EW_DONT_USE_INDEX_SURFACES.
  - The new define EW_DONT_USE_PXP_SOFTWARE_REPLACEMENT can be used to
    remove the software drawing functions for all graphical operations that
    are supported by PXP. Except for demos, there is no necessity to use
    software drawing operations for hardware accelerated operations.
  - The new define EW_DONT_USE_WARP_FUNCTIONS can be used to exclude the code
    of all scale, rotate and warp functions from the Graphics Engine in order
    to reduce the code size for simple projects.
  - The dependency to printf() function is removed: The function EwFormat()
    does not exist anymore and has been removed from ewextrte.c. The function
    EwPrint() is now part of the RTE itself and implements a subset of the
    printf() format escape sequences (%d, %u, %f, %s, %c, %x, %X).
  - The new function EwConsoleOutput() has been added to the extern RTE
    module ewextrte.c. The function is used to print the given message on
    the console. No additional formatting, etc. is needed.
  - The Garbage Collector within the Embedded Wizard RunTime Environment is
    completely redesigned and operates now iterative instead of recursive.
    As a result, the necessary stack size may be reduced and the performance
    of EwReclaimMemory() is improved.

* Version 9.10
  - Support of bidirectional text. The new operations to process bidi and shaping
    can be disabled by compiling the Graphics Engine with the defined macro
    EW_DONT_USE_BIDI_FUNCTIONS.
  - Size of Issue Buffer can be changed by setting the macro EW_MAX_ISSUE_BUFFER
    within the makefile or project. By default the value is 100.
    In order to save memory (1 issue allocates 64 bytes) the size can be reduced.
    For complex vector graphics with too much edges, the buffer size can be
    increased (1 issue stores 8 edges).
  - Support of double-buffered scratch-pad buffer. This mode makes it possible
    to prepare the content of one scratch-pad buffer, while the content of the
    other scratch-padd buffer is transferred to the display.
  - Support of NXP Pixel Pipeline - The PXP graphics accelerator hardware is
    now used for all hardware supported fill, copy and blend operations in case
    of color format RGB565, RGB888 and RGBA8888.

* Version 9.00
  - Support of vector graphics. The new operations to fill and stroke paths
    can be disabled by compiling the Graphics Engine with the defined macro
    EW_DONT_USE_PATH_FUNCTIONS.

* Version 8.30
  - The limitation for max. 256 pixel font height has been increased to 1024 pixel.
    To display such large fonts the glyph cache has to be large enough.
  - Text alignment algorithms (changed with V8.20) are reworked (bug-fix).

* Version 8.20
  - Support for i.MXRT1052


Supported Platforms and Color Formats:
--------------------------------------
This Platform Package supports the following chipsets and color formats:

iMX_RT       : iMX RT platforms
  + RGBA8888 : 32 bit color format with 8 bit red, 8 bit green, 8 bit blue
               and 8 bit alpha values.
  + RGB888   : 24 bit screen color format with 8 bit red, 8 bit green and 8 bit
               blue values.
  + RGB565   : 16 bit screen color format with 5 bit red, 6 bit green and 5 bit
               blue values.
  + Index8   : 8 bit index color format (global CLUT with up to 256 colors).
  + LumA44   : 8 bit color format with 4 bit luminance and 4 bit alpha values.
