* DESCRIPTION:
*   This header file belongs to the external platform adaptation layer of the
*   Embedded Wizard Runtime Environment. It abstracts the interface between the
*   platform independent core of Runtime Environment and the underlying, target
*   specific operating system and the used 'C' compiler version.
*
*   This header provides the interface by using the GCC compiler environment.
