/**
 * @file draft-api.h
 * @brief Manifest Manager API
 * @details This file specifies the API used to interact with the manifest manager
 * # Expected API call pattern
 * The update hub should call the API in the following way:
 * - The update hub initializes the manifest manager: `manifest_manager_init()`
 *     - TODO: The manifest manager checks internal consistency of the latest manifest.
 * - The udpate hub passes a manifest to the manifest manager: `manifest_manager_insert()`
 * - The manifest manager:
 *     - checks for validity of the manifest and exits with a failure if it is invalid.
 *         - validates the integrity of the manifest (hash)
 *         - validates the authenticity of the manifest (signature)
 *         - checks that the manifest applies to the local hardware
 *             - reports the Device, Vendor, and Device Class GUIDs to the update hub for validation.
 *     - searches for a matching dependency placeholder
 *     - if a match is found,
 *         - stores the manifest as a dependency
 *     - otherwise
 *        - TODO: Validates the timestamp.
 *          NOTE: Timestamp cannot be validated before this point since it is only validated on root manifests
 *        - stores the maninfest as a new root manifest
 *     - stores the firmware URI and hash (HACK: Also embeds the firmware size, inip vector and AES key in the hash)
 *     - stores a placeholder for each linked manifest
 *     - stores the manifest timestamp
 *     - The manifest manager searches for dependency placeholders
 *         - If there is a placeholder, report it to the hub and exit pending.
 *         - otherwise, report DONE to the hub.
 * - If the update hub receives a manifest request,
 *     - It obtains that manifest and calls `manifest_manager_insert()` starting this process again.
 * - If the update hub receives a DONE report,
 *     - It initiates a firmware request, using the `ARM_UC_mmFetchFirmwareInfo()` API
 *     - The manifest manager:
 *         - finds the most recent root manifest
 *         - searches for any firmware placeholders
 *         - reports the firmware to the hub
 * - Until the hub receives a DONE report, it
 *     - extracts the firmware information using `ARM_UC_mmGetFirmwareInfo()`
 *     - fetches the firmware image
 *     - installs the firmware image
 *     - starts the search for the next firmware, using `ARM_UC_mmFetchNextFirmwareInfo()`
