/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bi-quad Block IIR
  Computes a IIR filter (cascaded IIR direct form I or II using 5 
  coefficients per bi-quad + gain term) . Input data are stored in vector x. 
  Filter output samples are stored in vector r. The filter calculates N output 
  samples using SOS and G matrices.
  Filters are able to process data in following formats:
  -  real (just array of samples)
  -  2-way or complex (interleaved real/imaginary samples)
  -  3-way (stream of interleaved samples from 3 channels)
  The same coefficients are used for filtering of multiple channels or 
  real/imaginary parts and they are processed independently. 
  The same format have to be used both for input and output streams.
  NOTES:
  1. Bi-quad coefficients may be derived from standard SOS and G matrices
     generated by MATLAB. However, typically biquad stages have big peaks 
     in their step response which may cause undesirable overflows at the 
     intermediate outputs. To avoid that the additional scale factors 
     coef_g[M] may be applied. These per-section scale factors may require 
     some tuning to find a compromise between quantization noise and possible
     overflows. Output of the last section is directed to an additional 
     multiplier, with the gain factor being a power of two, either negative 
     or non-negative. It is specified through the total gain shift amount 
     parameter gain of each filter initialization function.
  2. 16x16 filters may suffer more from accumulation of the roundoff errors, 
     so filters should be properly designed to match noise requirements

  Input:
  N             length of input sample block. For 3-way functions (bq3iirxxx), 
                N is a number of triplets
  M             number of bi-quad sections
  s[]           scratch memory area (for fixed-point functions only), Minimum 
                number of bytes depends on selected filter structure and 
                precision. see table above .If a particular macro returns zero, 
                then the corresponding IIR doesn't require a scratch area and 
                parameter s may hold zero

  coef_sos[M*5] filter coefficients stored in blocks of 5 numbers: 
                b0 b1 b2 a1 a2. 
                For fixed-point funcions, fixed point format of filter 
                coefficients is Q1.14 for 32x16, or Q1.30 for 32x16 and 
                24x24 (in the latter case 8 LSBs are actually ignored). 
  coef_g[M]     scale factor for each section, Q15 (for fixed-point 
                functions only). Please note that 24x24 DFI implementation 
                internally truncates scale factors to Q7 values.
  gain          total gain shift amount applied to output signal of the
                last section, -48..15
  x[N]          input samples, Q31, Q15 or floating point. For 3-way functions 
                (bq3iirxxx), N is a number of triplets, so array size should be 
                3*N.

  Output:
  r[N]          output data, Q31, Q15 or floating point. For 3-way functions 
                (bq3iirxxx), N is a number of triplets, so array size should be 
                3*N.

  Restriction:
  x,r,s,coef_g,coef_sos should not overlap
  N   - must be a multiple of 2
  s[] - whenever supplied must be aligned on an 8-bytes boundary
