This release primarily contains changes to work with RI.6 xt-xcc and RI.7 xt-clang toolchain.  
The performance document has been updated with RI.6 xt-xcc mips numbers on FS_AVS_LE5_FP_XC core. 

Performance:   - RI.7 xt-clang related optimizations 
Other:   - DISCARD functionality updated to work with RI.7 tool chain.    - Test bench has been updated to include cmtx_inv4x4f kernel.    - The latrf kernel in IIR has been optimized using intrinsics. 
   - fno-unsafe-math-optimizations has been added for Floating point kernels.
   - the xws has been updated to work with both RI.6 xt-xcc and RI.7 xt-clang compilers.  Known Issues:   - Reordering issue for vec_tanf & vec_consinef kernel in RI6 xt-xcc with -O3.      So optimization has been set to -O2 -Os for these kernels for xt-xcc builds.     
All testing and functional validation have been done using 
  - RI.2021.7 xt-clang compiler version of the Xtensa Xplorer and tools.
  - RI.2021.6 xt-xcc compiler version of the Xtensa Xplorer and tools.
  
- The testing methodology and other configurations are same as previous release.- Please note, when one plans to use xt-clang compiler, the package is well tested with RI.7 tools.   Some limitations in xt-clang/RI.6 are taken care of well in xt-clang/RI.7. 

==============================================================Release Notes for NatureDSP library (Fusion F1)version: v1.1.0   ==============================================================

Xtensa Xplorer IDE and tools version:
All testing and performance measurements have been using RF.2017.5
  version of the Xtensa Xplorer and tools.

This release contains following changes:  
	- 16-bit FFT performance is improved (fft_cplx16x16, ifft_cplx16x16)
	- fixed bug with sNaN propagation in scalar math routines
	- improved Matlab code for IIR coefficient conversion in the API document  
  
NatureDSP_Signal Library Reference_Fusion_F1.doc
	- Added section "4.3 Accuracy of Mathematical Functions"

Known issues:
Function ceil() and floor() in Fusion F1 Base configuration propagates (input) sNaN 
to (output) sNaN. But Library testbench expects it to always return qNaN irrespective 
input qNaN or sNaN. This displays testcases failure.
	  
==============================================================Release Notes for NatureDSP library (Fusion F1)version: v1.0.0   ==============================================================
This is the first release of the NatureDSP Signal Library for Fusion F1.

Xtensa Xplorer IDE and tools version:
All testing and performance measurements have been using RF.2015.3
  version of the Xtensa Xplorer and tools.

Release includes functions for following categories for 32, 24, 16 bit fixed 
and single precision floating point data:
  - FIR filters and related functions
  - FIR filters for decimation and interpolation
  - IIR filters
  - Vector/scalar mathematics
  - Matrix operations (including quaternion to rotation matrix conversions)
  - Matrix inversion
  - FFT (real, complex FFTs with power of 2 sizes)
  - Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
