/*
    Twiddle tables are received by sequential writing twiddle factors used in the original fft loops
    However, last radix2/radix4 stage is omitted because they are processed separately and combined 
    with bitreversing
    Higher halfword of each item is a cosine of a twiddle angle and lower halfword is a sine. All numbers are
    represented in Q15. Twiddle angle is always an integral number multiplied by 2*pi/N where N is FFT length. 
    For example, the sequence of twiddle angles is:
    16-pts transform 
    [0 0 0 1 2 3 2 4 6 3 6 -7]/16
    32-pts transform 
    [0 0 0 1 2 3 2 4 6 3 6 9 4 8 12 5 10 15 6 12 -14 7 14 -11 0 0 0 4 8 12 0 0 0 4 8 12 0 0 0 4 8 12 0 0 0 4 8 12 ]/32
