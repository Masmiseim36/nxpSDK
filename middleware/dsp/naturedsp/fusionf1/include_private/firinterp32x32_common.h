/* Data processing function of a particular interpolating filter. Stores a
 * block of N input samples to the circular delay line buffer and computes
 * N*D samples of interpolating FIR filter's response.
 * Input:
 *   delayLine - circular delay line buffer start address
 *   delayLen  - Delay line buffer length
 *   wrIx    - next position in the buffer to be filled with an input sample
 *   x[N]    - input samples
 *   h[]     - decimating FIR filter coefficients, array layout varies
 * Output:
 *   y[N*D]  - output samples
 *   retval  - updated index of the oldest sample
 * Notes and restrictions:
 *   1. Most of data processing functions feature a single, hard-coded 
 *      interpolation factor, so they expect a determined value for parameter D.
 *   2. All pointers with the exception of y[N] must be aligned on an 8-bytes
 *      boundary.
 *   3. N - must be a multiple of 4.
 *   4. M - must be a multiple of 4. */
