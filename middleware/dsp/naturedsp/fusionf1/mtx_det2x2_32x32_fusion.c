  Operations with Small Matrices
  These functions implement basic operations under the sequence of small 
  square matrices. Fixed point data are interpreted as Q15 or Q31 and 
  results might be saturated.
  NOTE: 
  Determinant is computed recursively via minors of submatrices. So, in 
  the fixed-point routines, intermediate results might be saturated 
  although final result is in range. To avoid this saturation, right shift 
  might be applied at the first stage of computations. It means that final 
  result would be represented in Q(15-rsh) or Q(31-rsh) respectively. 
  Ad-hoc formula for rsh is rsh>=N-2 for real matrices and rsh>=N-1 for 
  complex matrices.

  Precision: 
  16x16  16-bit input, 16-bit output (real and complex)
  32x32  32-bit input, 32-bit output (real and complex)
  f      floating point (real and complex)

  Matrix dimensions are 2x2, 3x3, 4x4

  Input:
  x[L][N*N]      L input matrices
  y[L][N*N]      L input matrices (for addition, subtraction, multiply 
                 functions)
  rsh            right shift for fixed-point multiply and determinant 
                 function
  L              number of matrices
  Output:
  z[L][N*N]      L output matrices (for addition, subtraction, multiply, 
                 transpose functions)
  d[L]           determinants for L matrices (for determinant functions)

  Restrictions:
  rsh should be in range 0..15
  x,y,z should not overlap
