---------------- Library Release 4.1.0, August 2020-----

This release contains new functions (imaging) and performance improvements.
The performance measurements are obtained by using RI-2020.4 Xtensa Xplorer, tools, and HiFi4 core configurations with big memories. 


API:

- renamed Cholesky decomposition functions
- added Cholesky for floating point and 32-bit fixed point
- added batch dot product
- added image processing part
- IIR biquad filters with no end-to-end delay. Also added function requesting 
  actual algorithmic delay for faster IIR functions

  
New features:
