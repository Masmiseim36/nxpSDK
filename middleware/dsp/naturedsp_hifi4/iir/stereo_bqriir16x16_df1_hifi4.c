/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bi-quad Real Block IIR
  Computes a real IIR filter (cascaded IIR direct form I or II using 5 
  coefficients per bi-quad + gain term). Real input data are stored
  in vector x. The filter output result is stored in vector r. The filter 
  calculates N output samples using SOS and G matrices.
  NOTE:
  1. Bi-quad coefficients may be derived from standard SOS and G matrices 
  generated by MATLAB. However, typically biquad stages have big peaks 
  in their step response which may cause undesirable overflows at the 
  intermediate outputs. To avoid that the additional scale factors 
  coef_g[M] may be applied. These per-section scale factors may require 
  some tuning to find a compromise between quantization noise and possible 
  overflows. Output of the last section is directed to an additional 
  multiplier, with the gain factor being a power of two, either negative 
  or non-negative. It is specified through the total gain shift amount 
  parameter gain of each filter initialization function.
  2. 16x16 filters may suffer more from accumulation of the roundoff errors,
  so filters should be properly designed to match noise requirements

  Precision: 
  16x16         16-bit data, 16-bit coefficients, 16-bit intermediate 
                stage outputs (DF1, DF1 stereo, DF II form)
  32x16         32-bit data, 16-bit coefficients, 32-bit intermediate 
                (DF1, DF1 stereo, DF II form) stage outputs
  32x32         32-bit data, 32-bit coefficients, 32-bit intermediate 
                (DF I, DF1 stereo,  DF II form) stage outputs 
  f             floating point (DF I, DF1 stereo, DF II and DF IIt)

  Input:
  N             length of input sample block
  M             number of bi-quad sections
  S             1 for mono, 2 for stereo API
  s[]           scratch memory area (for fixed-point functions only). 
                Minimum number of bytes depends on selected filter structure 
                and precision:
                  BQRIIR16X16_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR16X16_DF2_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR32X16_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR32X16_DF2_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR32X32_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ), or
                  BQRIIR32X32_DF2_SCRATCH_SIZE( N,  M ),
                  STEREO_BQRIIR16X16_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE( N, M ) , or
                  STEREO_BQRIIR32X32_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE( N, M ) , or
                  STEREO_BQRIIRF_DF1_SCRATCH_SIZE    ( N, M )
                 If a particular macro returns zero, then the corresponding
                 IIR doesn't require a scratch area and parameter s may 
                 hold zero.
  coef_sos[M*5]  filter coefficients stored in blocks of 5 numbers: 
                 b0 b1 b2 a1 a2. 
                 For fixed-point funcions, fixed point format of filter 
                 coefficients is Q1.14 for 16x16 and 32x16, or Q1.30 for 32x32 
  coef_sosl[M*5] filter coefficients for the left channel (stereo filters only)
  coef_sosr[M*5] filter coefficients for the left channel (stereo filters only)

                 functions only)

                 only)
  gainr          total gain shift amount for the right channel (stereo filters 
                 only)

  x[N*S]         input samples, Q15, Q31 or floating point. Stereo samples 
                 go in interleaved order (left, right)
  Output:
  r[N*S]         output data, Q15, Q31 or floating point. Stereo samples go 
                 in interleaved order (left, right)
