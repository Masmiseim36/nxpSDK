 * the new identity will only be stored persistently in flash when this API

 * provided, since in such a situation the app clearly has some place it got
 * the address from and will be able to repeat the procedure on every power
 * cycle, i.e. it would be redundant to also store the information in flash.

 * to first initialize the stack (using bt_enable), then call settings_load(),
