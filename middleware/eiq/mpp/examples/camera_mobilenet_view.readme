Overview
========

This example shows how to use the library to create two image classification use-cases:
- image classification using camera as source
- image classification using a file as source

The machine learning frameworks used are TensorFlow Lite Micro or GLOW
The image classification model used is quantized Mobilenet
convolutional neural network model [1] that classifies the input image into
one of 1000 output classes.

Use-cases Description
=====================


1- Image classification using camera as source
   --------------------------------------------

HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION:
To classify an image, place an image in front of camera so that it fits in the blue rectangle in the middle of the display.
Some images will work better than others.

1-b) Detailed description
     --------------------

Application creates two pipelines:

- One pipeline that runs the camera preview.
- Another pipeline that runs the ML inference on the image coming from the camera.
- Pipeline 1 is split from pipeline 0
- Pipeline 0 executes the processing of each element sequentially and CANNOT be preempted by another pipeline.
- Pipeline 1 executes the processing of each element sequentially but CAN be preempted.

1-c) Pipelines elements description
     ------------------------------

* Camera element is configured to output YUV444 images at 1280x720 resolution
* Display element is configured to receive RGB565 images at 720x1280 resolution
* 2D convert element on pipeline 0 is configured to perform:
  - color space conversion from YUV444 to RGB565
  - 90 degres rotation from 1280x720 to 720x1280

* 2D convert element on pipeline 1 is configured to perform:
  - color space conversion from YUV444 to RGB888
  - cropping to 720x720 to maintain image aspect ratio
  - scaling from 720x720 to 128x128 as mandated by the image classification model

* The labeled rectangle element draws a crop window from which the camera image is sent to
  the ML inference element. The labeled rectangle element also displays the label of the object detected.
* The ML inference element runs an inference on the image pre-processed by the 2D convert element.
* The NULL sink element closes pipeline 1 (in MPP concept, only sink elements can close a pipeline).

* At every inference, the ML inference element invokes a callback containing the inference outputs.
These outputs are post-processed by the callback client component (in this case, the main task of the application)

2- Image classification with static image as source
   ------------------------------------------------

In this use-case, same pipelines are created as for use-case described in section 1).
The only difference is a static image element that replaces the camera element.
Image outputs same image format as camera source, but with a different resolution
(168x208 instead of 1280x720).


Running the demo
================

The same application supports both pipelines. The camera preview pipeline is the default one.
In order to build the image preview pipeline instead, please set up the following variable at the
beginning of the camera_mobilenet_view.c file:

#define SOURCE_STATIC_IMAGE 1

EXPECTED OUTPUTS:
The expected outputs of the example are:
- Detected label should be displayed on the screen
- Logs below should be displayed on the debug console
