NXP FreeMASTER Communication Driver
================================================================================

FreeMASTER is a PC-based application serving as a real-time monitor, visualization 
tool, and a graphical control panel of embedded applications based on NXP 
microcontroller and microprocessor units. The FreeMASTER Serial Communication 
Driver implements the serial interface between the target application and the host PC. 
The driver targets Serial and CAN communication of the supported devices.

This is version 3.0 of the serial driver which implements a new version (v4) of
FreeMASTER protocol and is compatible with NXP MCUXpresso SDK suite. The driver 
may be obtained as an MCUXpresso SDK middleware component from 
https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/en/welcome.

Older implementations of FreeMASTER serial driver for platforms that are not 
supported by MCUXpresso SDK (e.g. HCS08, HCS12, S12Z, ColdFire, 56F8xxx) can 
be downloaded from FreeMASTER home at https://www.nxp.com/freemaster.
