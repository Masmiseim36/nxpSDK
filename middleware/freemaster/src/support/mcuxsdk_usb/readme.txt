Files in this directory are used by the FreeMASTER example application 
as a glue layer between the application code and USB stack.

This code is based on standard USB/CDC Virtual Com example application 
from the MCUXpresso SDK.

Please note that similar files can be generated by a FreeMASTER middleware 
configuration component of MCUXpresso ConfigTools when it is used 
to configure the FreeMASTER driver for a USB-CDC transport.
