    \brief ApplyPerturbation function used to analyze dynamic performance

    The ApplyPerturbation function applies a user-specified step function to
    prior fusion results which is then "released" in the next fusion cycle.
    When used in conjustion with the NXP Sensor Fusion Toolbox, this provides
    a visual indication of the dynamic behavior of the library.
