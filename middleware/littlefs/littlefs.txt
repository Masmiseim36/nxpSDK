Littlefs is a little fail-safe filesystem designed for microcontrollers.

Requirements of littlefs regarding KSDK and MCUXpresso:
Littlefs does not build with Redlib library, due to some missing headers,
namely intypes.h, that Redlib does not provide.
It is recommended to link you application utilizing littlefs against Newlib: NewlibNano (nohost) would suffice.
Please observe the library options especially when creating new project including littlefs using MCUX wizard.
