@section lwip lwIP for MCUXpresso SDK
  Lightweight IP (lwIP) is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite.
  Source code included in this SDK is based on development version 2.2.0.dev taken from 3rd party lwIP GIT repository.
  The webpage https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git allows to browse the repository and also contains URLs for its cloning.
  The development versions (X.Y.Z.dev) do not refer to a single source code snapshots. To avoid ambiguity,
  change log below contains SHA-1 hashes of GIT commits used when importing the code into the SDK.

  - 2.2.0_rev5
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2021-05-11, branch: master, SHA-1: 7ec4e9be304e7f8953740f10b2c810a292e89449) to MCUXpresso SDK.
      - LPC ENET adaptation layer allocates more buffers for frame reception now.
        Previously the number of receive buffers was determined by ENET_RXBD_NUM, which defaults to 5.
        It is determined by ENET_RXBUFF_NUM now, which is 2 * ENET_RXBD_NUM by default.
        Increase was needed because the actual version of LPC ENET driver always hold ENET_RXBD_NUM number of buffers
        and few additional buffers are needed for passing zero-copy frame data to lwIP.
        If this takes too much memory in your application, you can counteract by decreasing PBUF_POOL_SIZE,
        since PBUF_POOL is used only for transmission when LPC ENET, Kinetis ENET or ENET QOS is used.

  - 2.2.0_rev4
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2021-03-05, branch: master, SHA-1: 0056522cc974d2be2005c324f37187b5b3695765) to KSDK 2.0.0.
      - LWIP_DHCP_DOES_ACD_CHECK option default changed to 0 (disabled):
        - Although the ACD check makes getting IP address from DHCP more robust, it added several seconds delay at startup of all applications which use DHCP.
        - This feature was not present in earlier versions of lwIP.
      - ENET QOS adaptation layer - implemented zero-copy on receive.
      - Kinetis ENET and ENET QOS adaptation layers allocate more buffers for frame reception now.
        Previously the number of receive buffers was determined by ENET_RXBD_NUM, which defaults to 5.
        It is determined by ENET_RXBUFF_NUM now, which is 2 * ENET_RXBD_NUM by default.
        Increase was needed because the actual version of Kinetis ENET and ENET QOS drivers always hold ENET_RXBD_NUM number of buffers
        and few additional buffers are needed for passing zero-copy frame data to lwIP.
        If this takes too much memory in your application, you can counteract by decreasing PBUF_POOL_SIZE,
        since PBUF_POOL is used only for transmission when Kinetis ENET or ENET QOS is used.
      - Removed ethernetif_config_t.non_dma_memory field which was required to configure memory ranges unusable by ENET DMA on LPC devices.
        The setting has been replaced by BOARD_ENET_NON_DMA_MEMORY_ARRAY macro.

  - 2.2.0_rev3
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2020-07-07, branch: master, SHA-1: c385f31076b27efb8ee37f00cb5568783a58f299) to KSDK 2.0.0.

  - 2.2.0_rev2
    - New features:
      - Kinetis ENET adaptation layer - implemented zero-copy on receive.
      - lwiperf - counter of transferred bytes extended from 32 to 64 bit
    - Bug fixes:

  - 2.2.0_rev1
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2019-12-12, branch: master, SHA-1: 555812dcec38c9a2ef1ef9b31816291549fbf9f8) to KSDK 2.0.0.
      - Implemented LWIP_ASSERT_CORE_LOCKED related functions in sys_arch.c. It can be enabled in lwipopts.h:
        - <tt>\#define LWIP_ASSERT_CORE_LOCKED() sys_check_core_locking()</tt>
        - <tt>\#define LWIP_MARK_TCPIP_THREAD() sys_mark_tcpip_thread() // if NO_SYS == 0</tt>
        - <tt>\#define LOCK_TCPIP_CORE() sys_lock_tcpip_core() // if NO_SYS == 0 and LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING == 1</tt>
        - <tt>\#define UNLOCK_TCPIP_CORE() sys_unlock_tcpip_core() // if NO_SYS == 0 and LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING == 1</tt>

  - 2.1.2_rev5
    - New features:
      - Implemented TCP_USER_TIMEOUT socket option.
      - Implemented SIOCOUTQ ioctl.

  - 2.1.2_rev4
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.1.3.dev (2019-02-27, branch: STABLE-2_1_x, SHA-1: 1bb6e7f52de1cd86be0eed31e348431edc2cd01e) to KSDK 2.0.0.
      - Updated sys_thread_new implementation and comment.
      - Kinetis ENET adaptation layer - reading frames into a pbuf chain is conditionally compiled only when a single pbuf from pool
        cannot hold maximum frame size (PBUF_POOL_BUFSIZE >= maximum frame size).
        Avoiding this code also reduces stack size requirements by about 1.5 kilobytes.
    - Bug fixes:
      - Fixes in ethernetif_linkoutput() in enet_ethernetif_lpc.c:
        - Removed access to possibly freed pbuf.
        - Call pbuf_free() when transmit buffers not available.
        - When copying pbuf chain, updating the number of necessary transmit buffers to wait for, which can be often smaller in the copy.
      - When CGI script is reading POST data by chunks, the loop in httpsrv_read() may cause blocking in receive function waiting for more data at the end of the stream
        - HTTPSRV_cgi_read() - added limiting of the last chunk length according to content length to avoid undesired blocking
      - Applied AUTOIP patch https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?9847 - with modification to support multiple network interfaces.
      - Fixed buffer overflow in httpsrv when application provided CGI script does not handle the whole content of POST request
    - Removed LwipMibCompiler contrib application as it contained LGPL licensed files in SharpSnmpLib.
