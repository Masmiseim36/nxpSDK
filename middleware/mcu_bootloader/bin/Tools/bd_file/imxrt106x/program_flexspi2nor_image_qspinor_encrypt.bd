    #1. Prepare Flash option
    # In this example, the 0xc0000007 represents:
    #     QSPI FLASH, Query pads: 1 pad, Cmd pads: 1 pad, Frequency: 133MHz
    load 0xc0000007 > 0x2000;

    # bit[23:20] AES mode: 1 - CTR mode
    # bit[19:16] Encrypted region count
    # bit[15:00] reserved in A0

    # 0xf000000f is the tag to notify Flashloader to program FlexSPI NOR config block to the start of device

    # Notify Flashloader to response the option at address 0x3000
