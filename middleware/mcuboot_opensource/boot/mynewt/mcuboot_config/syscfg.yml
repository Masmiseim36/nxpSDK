    BOOTUTIL_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION:
        description: >
            Select downgrade prevention strategy.
            - none downgrades are allowed
            - version:
                Prevent downgrades by enforcing incrementing version numbers.
                When this option is set, any upgrade must have greater major version
                or greater minor version with equal major version. This mechanism
                only protects against some attacks against version downgrades (for
                example, a JTAG could be used to write an older version).
            - security_counter:
                security counter is used for version eligibility check instead of pure
                version.  When this option is set, any upgrade must have greater or
                equal security counter value.
                Because of the acceptance of equal values it allows for software
                downgrades to some extent.
        choices:
            - none
            - version
            - security_counter
        value: none
    BOOTUTIL_VERSION_CMP_USE_BUILD_NUMBER:
        description: >
            Use build number while comparing image version.
            By default, the image version comparison relies only on version major,
            minor and revision. Enable this option to take into account the build
            number as well.
            This only affect builds with BOOTUTIL_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION set to version.

            Prevent undesirable/malicious software downgrades. When this option is
            set, any upgrade must have greater or equal security counter value.
            Because of the acceptance of equal values it allows for software
            downgrade to some extent

            Store the boot state/measurements in shared memory.
            If enabled, the bootloader will store certain boot measurements such as
            the hash of the firmware image in a shared memory area. This data can
            be used later by runtime services (e.g. by a device attestation service).
