//! Size of the temporary buffer to hold the formatted output string.
#define WIN32_FMT_BUF_LEN (2048)

//! The purpose of this function to provide a convenient way of generating formatted
//! STL strings inline. This is especially useful when throwing exceptions that take
//! a std::string for a message. The length of the formatted output string is limited
//! only by memory. Memory temporarily allocated for the output string is disposed of
//! before returning.
//!
//! For Win32, the maximum output size is 2048 characters. For POSIX systems, there
//! is no fixed maximum because the vasprintf() function that allocates exactly
//! the required storage is available.
//!
//! Example usage:
//! \code
//!		throw std::runtime_error(format_string("error on line %d", line));
//! \endcode
//!
//! \param fmt Format string using printf-style format markers.
//! \return An STL string object of the formatted output.
