/** \defgroup ph_RefDefs Platform Definitions
* \brief Platform depending definitions for memory location of variables.
*
* We distinguish between:
*   - BUFFERs   : Location of storage, usually mid-speed but max. RAM consumption,
*   - COUNTERs  : loop counters or frequently accessed variables, fast access,
*   - REMINDERs : variables holding status values or serving flow control purposes.
*
* If RCL is used on a microcontroller, an own REFDEF.H file must be generated where the
* RCL_MEMLOC_... definition must get according values. Default definitions are empty.
*
* Assignment Example: XDATA for #PH_MEMLOC_BUF,
*                     IDATA for #PH_MEMLOC_COUNT,
*                     EDATA for #PH_MEMLOC_REM.
