@section mmc MMC Card driver for MCUXpresso SDK
  The current driver version is 2.4.1.

  - 2.4.1
    - Improvements
      - Improved the voltage window argument of CMD1 according to host capabilty instead of use card ocr directly.
      - Added host HS200/HS400/8bit bus width capability validation during card initialization.
      - Used cache line size align buffer for MMC relate api.
      - Increased the CMD13 timeout count to avoid polling CMD13 time out issue.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed violations of MISRA C-2012 rule 11.9, 15.7, 4.7, 16.4, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 11.3, 14.4, 10.6, 17.7, 16.1, 16.3.

  - 2.3.1
    - Improvements
      - Removed the dead loop while polling DAT0 and CMD13 instead of using timeout mechanism.
      - Added card state check before switching to HS400 to improve the emmc initialization stability.
      - Removed the redundant operation of memset internal buffer in MMC_WrtiteBlocks function.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the sandisk emmc always busy while sending CMD1 without supported voltage provide in argument.

  - 2.3.0
    - Improvements
      - Deprecated api MMC_PowerOnCard/MMC_PowerOffCard by api MMC_SetCardPower.
      - Added internalBuffer in mmc_card_t and removed rawCid/rawCsd/rawExtendedCsd.
      - Added retuning support during data transfer under HS200 mode.
      - Increased the read/write blocks failed retry times for stability.
      - Added delay while retry the CMD1 for stability.
      - Added legacy card support, the card not support CMD6, CMD8.

  - 2.2.13
    - Improvements
      - Used the boot mode value instead of boot mode mask value as the parameter of MMC_SetBootConfig to improve user experience.
      - Removed dynamic voltage switch feature for mmc, according to JEDEC standard, the voltage should be fixed after power up.

  - 2.2.12
    - Improvement
      - Increased the CMD1 retry times in the MMC card driver to improve driver compatibility.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the build warning by changing the old style function declaration static
        status_t inline to static inline status_t(found by adding -Wold-style-declaration in armgcc build flag).
      - Fixed the fall through build warning by adding SUPPRESS_FALL_THROUGH_WARNING() in mmc driver.

  - 2.2.7
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed MDK 66-D warning.

  - 2.2.6
    - Improvements
      - Saved MMC OCR registers while sending CMD1 with argument 0.

    - Bug Fixes
      - Added MMC_PowerOn function in which there is delay function after powerup sdcard. Otherwise, the
        card initialization by fail.

  - 2.2.5
    - Improvements
      - Added SDMMC_ENABLE_SOFTWARE_TUNING to enable/disable software tuning and it is disabled by default.

  - 2.2.4
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed DDR mode data sequence miss issue, which is caused by NIBBLE_POS.

    - Improvements
      - Increased g_sdmmc 512byte to improve the performance when application use a non-word align data buffer address.
      - Used OCR access mode bits to determine the mmccard high capacity flag.

  - 2.2.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Added response check for send operation condition command. If not checked, the card may occasionally init fail.

  - 2.2.1
    - Improvements

      - Added strobe dll for mmc HS400 mode.
      - Added write complete wait operation for MMC_Write to fix command timeout issue.

  - 2.1.2
    - Improvements
      - Improved SDMMC to support eMMC v5.0.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed incorrect comparison between count and length in MMC_ReadBlocks/MMC_WriteBlocks.

  - 2.1.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the block range boundary error when transferring data to MMC card.

  - 2.1.0
    - Improvements
      - Optimized the function of setting maximum data bus width for MMC card.

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version
