@section se_hostlib Secure Element hostlib for KSDK

  - 2.11.0
    - Added Support for SE050 and SSS API's
    - For Detailed change log please download the Plug & Trust MW package from
      https://www.nxp.com/products/:SE050?tab=Design_Tools_Tab
      and refer to the Changes Present in the User guide.

  - 1.6.0
    - Host Library version goes from 01.40 to 01.41 (A71CH Host API has not been extended)
    - Conditional translation of i2c_Failed into i2c_NoAddrAck removed (this translation is no longer required as a NACK is no longer lumped into i2c_Failed by the I2C driver wrapper)
    - Additional update of SCI2C implementation: Ensure multiple consecutive NACK’s on address will trigger a return from function ‘sci2c_SlaveToMasterDataTx’.
    - sci2c_Init update: initial loop fetching sci2c status modified so a SoftReset is issued for all exception types.
    - Solved potential buffer overflow in the implementation of smApduAppendCmdData
    - Added additional explicit checks that pointer arguments passed at the AX_API/A71CH_API level are not NULL pointers. In case this check was done through an ‘assert’ statement, the ‘assert’ statement has been removed.

  - 1.5.0
    - Added i.MX RT1050 EVKB and LPC54018 IoT module projects
    - Added Watson IoT demo
    - GP Storage Lookup table is no longer restricted to 5 objects, up to 254 objects can be stored (use HLSE_MAX_OBJECTS_IN_TABLE (>=8) to limit support and save memory)
    - GP Storage Update Counter can be disabled by defining HLSE_DISABLE_UPDATE_COUNTER (not defined by default).
    - It’s possible to fetch the absolute storage offset of an object
    - Specific error code when attempting to update a locked Lookup table
    - Extended doxygen documentation

  - 1.4.2
    - Upgraded rtos\amazon-freertos\lib\pkcs11\portable\nxp\se_hostlib\pkcs11_se.c
    - Added GCP (Google Cloud Platform Demo)
    - Readme updates for AWS JITR Demo

  - 1.4.0.1
    - Examples: Fix time stamp printing on embedded platform.
      (Time stams are supported only for Linux/Windows)
