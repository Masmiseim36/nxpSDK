.. |DS5_VERSION| replace:: v5.29.1
.. |KEIL_VERSION| replace:: v5.25.2
.. |DEV_STUDIO_VERSION| replace:: 2018.0

A quick reference table is included in the
:ref:`docs/getting_started/tfm_sw_requirement:Tool & Dependency overview` section
of this document.

****************************
Supported build environments
****************************

TF-M officially supports a limited set of build environments and setups. In
this context, official support means that the environments listed below
are actively used by team members and active developers hence users should
be able to recreate the same configurations by following the instructions
described below. In case of problems, the TF-M team provides support
only for these environments, but building in other environments can still be
possible.

The following environments are supported:

    - Ubuntu 16.04 x64
    - Ubuntu 18.04 x64
    - Windows 10 x64 + git-bash (MinGW) + gnumake from DS-5 or msys2.
    - Windows 10 x64 + Cygwin x64 (example configuration is provided for
      this Windows setup only).

.. note::
    Some tools (i.e. python3 and CMake) must NOT be installed from
    Cygwin and instead a native windows version is needed. Please see the
    chapter `Windows + Cygwin setup`_ below.
    IAR requires Ubuntu 18.04 or later.

*********************
Supported C compilers
*********************

To compile TF-M code, at least one of the supported compiler toolchains have to
be available in the build environment. The currently supported compiler
versions are:

    - Arm Compiler v6.10
    - Arm Compiler v6.11
    - Arm Compiler v6.12
    - Arm Compiler v6.13
    - GNU Arm compiler v6.3.1
    - GNU Arm compiler v7.3
    - IAR Arm compiler v8.42.x
    - IAR Arm compiler v8.50.x

.. Note::
    - The Arm compilers above are provided via Keil uVision |KEIL_VERSION|
      or greater, DS-5 |DS5_VERSION| or greater, and Development Studio
      |DEV_STUDIO_VERSION| or greater, or they can be downloaded as standalone
      packages from
      `here <https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers/arm-compiler/downloads/version-6>`__.

    - Arm compiler specific environment variable may need updating based
      on specific products and licenses as explained in
      `product-and-toolkit-configuration <https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/license-management/resources/product-and-toolkit-configuration>`__.

    - The GNU Arm compiler can be downloaded from
      `here <https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads>`__.
      On the page select *GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain: 6-2017-q1-update*
      or *GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain: 7-2018-q2-update*

    - The IAR Arm compilers above are provided via IAR Embedded Workbench (Windows) or
      IAR build tools for linux.
      For information, see
      `here <https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/#!?architecture=Arm>`__ or
      `here <https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/build-tools-for-linux/>`__.

************************
Supported CMake versions
************************

The build-system is CMake based and supports the following versions:

    - 3.7
    - 3.10
    - 3.11
    - 3.12
    - 3.13
    - 3.14

.. Note::
    - Please use the latest build version available (i.e. 3.7.2 instead of
      3.7.0).
      While it is preferable to use the newest version this is not required
      and any version from the above list should work.
    - Recent versions of CMake can be downloaded from
      https://cmake.org/download/, and older releases are available from
      https://cmake.org/files.
    - For Cygwin users, please use a native windows CMake version
      instead of the version installed with Cygwin.
    - IAR requires version 3.14 or later.

***************************
Supported GNU make versions
***************************

The TF-M team builds using the "Unix Makefiles" generator of CMake and
thus GNU make is needed for the build. On Linux please use the version
available from the official repository of your distribution.

On Windows the following binaries are supported:

    - GNU make v4.2.1 executable from Cygwin
    - GNU make v4.2.1 executable from msys2
    - GNU make v4.2 executable from DS5 |DS5_VERSION| (see <DS5 directory>/bin)

CMake is quite tolerant to GNU make versions and basically any
"reasonably recent" GNU make version should work.

CMake generators other than "Unix Makefiles" may work, but are not
officially supported.

*********************
External dependencies
*********************

In order to build TF-M the following external projects are required:

    - `Mbed Crypto library <https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto>`__ v3.0.1
      is used as crypto library on the secure side
    - `MCUboot <https://github.com/JuulLabs-OSS/mcuboot>`__ v1.6.0 is used as
      the default bootloader in TF-M

And the following TF-M projects as well:
    - `TF-M tests <https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-M/tf-m-tests.git>`__

Each of the listed dependencies should be placed in a common root directory
with trustedfirmware-m

.. code-block:: bash

    .
    ├── mbed-crypto
    ├── mcuboot
    ├── tf-m-tests
    └── trusted-firmware-m

********************************************
Tools for configuring and programming boards
********************************************

For stm32l5xx boards, `STM32_Programmer_CLI  <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html>`__
is used to configure security protections and to write the code in internal flash.
A version is available for Linux and Windows host machine.

**************
Example setups

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If applicable, import Arm Compiler v6.10 in your shell console. To make this
change permanent, add the command line into ~/.bashrc

Armclang + DS-5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. Note::

    - Arm compiler specific environment variable may need updating based on
      specific products and licenses as explained in
      `product-and-toolkit-configuration <https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/license-management/resources/product-and-toolkit-configuration>`__.
    - Arm licensing related environment variables must use Windows paths, and not
      the Cygwin specific one relative to */cygrive*.

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=/cygdrive/c/<DS-5_PATH>/sw/ARMCompiler6.10/bin:$PATH
    export ARM_PRODUCT_PATH=C:/<DS-5_PATH>/sw/mappings
    export ARM_TOOL_VARIANT=ult
    export ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE=<LICENSE_FILE_PATH>

Armclang + Keil MDK Arm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Note::

    - Arm compiler specific environment variable may need updating based
      on specific products and licenses as explained in
      `product-and-toolkit-configuration <https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/license-management/resources/product-and-toolkit-configuration>`__.

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=/cygdrive/c/<uVision path>/ARM/ARMCLANG/bin:$PATH

GNU Arm
^^^^^^^

If applicable, import GNU Arm compiler v6.3.1 in your shell console. To make
this change permanent, add the command line into ~/.bashrc

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=<GNU Arm path>/bin:$PATH

CMake
^^^^^

To import CMake in your bash shell console:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=/cygdrive/c/<CMake path>/bin:$PATH

Building the documentation
==========================

The build system is prepared to support generation of two documents.
The Reference Manual which is Doxygen based, and the User Guide which is
Sphinx based. Both document can be generated in HTML and PDF format.

.. Note::

    Support for document generation in the build environment is not mandatory.
    Missing document generation tools will not block building the TF-M
    firmware.

To compile the TF-M Reference Manual

    - Graphviz dot v2.38.0 or later
    - PlantUML v1.2018.11 or later
    - Java runtime environment 1.8 or later (for running PlantUML)
