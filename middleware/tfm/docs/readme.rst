Trusted Firmware M
##################
Trusted Firmware M provides a reference implementation of secure world software
for ARMv8-M.

.. Note::
    The software implementation contained in this project is designed to be a
    reference implementation of the Platform Security Architecture (PSA).

Terms ``TFM`` and ``TF-M`` are commonly used in documents and code and both
refer to ``Trusted Firmware M.`` :doc:`Glossary </docs/glossary>` has the list
of terms and abbreviations.

License
#######
The software is provided under a BSD-3-Clause :doc:`License </docs/lic>`.
Contributions to this project are accepted under the same license with developer
sign-off as described in the :doc:`Contributing Guidelines </docs/processes/contributing>`.

This project contains code from other projects as listed below. The code from
external projects is limited to ``app`` and ``platform`` folders.
The original license text is included in those source files.

- The ``platform`` folder currently contains drivers imported from external
  project and the files have Apache 2.0 license.
- The ``app`` folder contains files imported from CMSIS_5 project and the files
  have Apache 2.0 license.
- The ``bl2`` folder contains files imported from MCUBoot project and the files

Getting Started
###############

************
Prerequisite
************
Trusted Firmware M provides a reference implementation of PSA specifications.
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with PSA concepts and terms. PSA
specifications are currently not available in the public domain.

The current TF-M implementation specifically targets TrustZone for ARMv8-M so a
good understanding of the v8-M architecture is also necessary. A good place to
get started with ARMv8-M is
`developer.arm.com <https://developer.arm.com/technologies/trustzone>`__.

**********************
Really getting started
**********************
Trusted Firmware M source code is available on `git.trustedfirmware.org
<https://git.trustedfirmware.org/trusted-firmware-m.git/>`__

To build & run TF-M:

    - Follow the :doc:`SW requirements guide </docs/user_guides/tfm_sw_requirement>`
      to set up your environment.
    - Follow the
      :doc:`Build instructions </docs/user_guides/tfm_build_instruction>` to compile
      and build the TF-M source.
    - Follow the :doc:`User guide </docs/user_guides/tfm_user_guide>` for information
      on running the example.

To port TF-M to a another system or OS, follow the
:doc:`OS Integration Guide </docs/user_guides/tfm_integration_guide>`

Please also see the :doc:`glossary </docs/glossary>` of terms used in the project.

:doc:`Contributing Guidelines </docs/processes/contributing>` contains guidance on how to
contribute to this project.

Further documents can be found in the ``docs`` folder.
