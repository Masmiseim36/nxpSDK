    Application RoT
    Application Root of Trust
        `PSA term`_. The security domain in which additional security services
        are implemented.

    HAL
    Hardware Abstraction Layer
        Interface to abstract hardware-oriented operations and provides a set of
        APIs to the upper layers.

    RoT
    Root of Trust
        `PSA term`_. This is the minimal set of software, hardware and data that
        is implicitly trusted in the platform â€” there is no software or hardware
        at a deeper level that can verify that the Root of Trust is authentic
        and unmodified.

    RoT Service
    Root of Trust Service.
        `PSA term`_. A set of related security operations that are implemented
        in a Secure Partition.

    NSPE : TF-M related
    Non Secure Processing Enviroment
        `PSA term`_. In TF-M this means non secure domain typically running an
        OS using services provided by TF-M.

    PSA
        `PSA term`_. Platform Security Architecture.

    PSA-FF
        `PSA term`_. Platform Security Architecture Firmware Framework.

    PSA-FF-M
        `PSA term`_. Platform Security Architecture Firmware Framework for M.

    PSA RoT
    PSA Root of Trust
        `PSA term`_. This defines the most trusted security domain within a PSA
        system.

    SFN : TF-M related
    Secure Function
        The function entry to a secure service. Multiple SFN per SS are
        permitted.

    SP : TF-M related
    Secure Partition
        A logical container for secure services.

    SPE : TF-M related
    Secure Processing Environment
        `PSA term`_. In TF-M this means the secure domain protected by TF-M.

    SPM : TF-M related
    Secure Partition Manager
        The TF-M component responsible for enumeration, management and isolation
        of multiple Secure Partitions within the TEE.

    SPRT : TF-M related
    Secure Partition Runtime
        The TF-M component responsible for Secure Partition runtime
        functionalities.

    SPRTL : TF-M related
    Secure Partition Runtime Library
        A library contains the SPRT code and data.

    SS : TF-M related
    Secure Service
        A component within the TEE that is atomic from a security/trust point of
        view, i.e. which is viewed as a single entity from a TF-M point of view.

    PS : TF-M related
    Protected Storage
        Protected storage service provided by TF-M.

    ITS : TF-M related
    Internal Trusted Storage
        Internal Trusted Storage service provided by TF-M.

    TFM
    TF-M
    Trusted Firmware-M
    Trusted Firmware for M-class
        ARM TF-M provides a reference implementation of secure world software
        for ARMv8-M.

    TBSA-M
    Trusted Base System Architecture for Armv6-M, Armv7-M and Armv8-M
        TBSA term. See `Trusted Base System Architecture for Armv6-M, Armv7-M
        and Armv8-M`_
