Introduction
************
Secure Partition is an execution environment that provides the following
functions to Root of Trust (RoT) Services:

- Access to resources, protection of its own code and data.
- Mechanisms to interact with other components in the system.

Each Secure Partition is a single thread of execution and the smallest unit of
isolation.

This document mainly describes how to add a secure partition in TF-M and
focuses on the configuration, manifest, implement rules. The actual
source-level implementation is not included in this document.

.. Note::
   If not otherwise specified, the steps are identical for library and IPC
   model.

   The IPC model conforms the *PSA Firmware Framework (FF) v 1.0.0*. Refer to
   `PSA Firmware Framework specification`_ for details.

*******
Process
*******
The main steps to add a secure partition are as follows:

- `Add source folder`_
- `Add manifest`_
- `Add configuration`_
- `Implement the RoT services`_

Add source folder
=================
Add a source folder under ``<TF-M base folder>/secure_fw/partitions`` for the new
secure partition (Let's take EXAMPLE as the folder name):

This folder should include those parts:

- Manifest file: EXAMPLE.yaml
- CMake configuration files
- Source code files

Add manifest
============
Each Secure Partition must have resource requirements declared in a manifest
file. The Secure Partition Manager (SPM) uses the manifest file to assemble and
allocate resources within the SPE. The manifest includes the following:

- A Secure Partition name.
- A list of implemented RoT Services.
- Access to other RoT Services.
- Memory requirements.
- Scheduling hints.
- Peripheral memory-mapped I/O regions and interrupts.

.. Note::
   The current manifest format in TF-M is "yaml" which is different from the
   requirement of PSA FF.

Here is a manifest reference example for the IPC model, please refer to
`Library model support`_ for the library extend:

.. code-block:: yaml

  {
    "psa_framework_version": 1.0,
    "name": "TFM_SP_EXAMPLE",
    "type": "PSA-ROT",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "entry_point": "example_main",
    "stack_size": "0x0200",
    "services" : [
      {
        "name": "ROT_A",
        "sid": "0x0000F000",
        "non_secure_clients": true,
        "version": 1,
        "version_policy": "STRICT"
      }
    ],
    "mmio_regions": [
      {
        "name": "TFM_PERIPHERAL_A",
        "permission": "READ-WRITE"
      }
    ],
    "irqs": [
      {
        "source": "TFM_A_IRQ",
        "signal": "SPM_CORE_A_IRQ",
      }
    ],
    "linker_pattern": {
      "object_list": [
        "*EXAMPLE.*"
      ]
    }
  }

Secure Partition ID Distribution
--------------------------------
Every Secure Partition has an identifier (ID). TF-M will generate a header file
that includes definitions of the Secure Partition IDs. The header file is
``<TF-M base folder>/interface/include/psa_manifest/pid.h``. Each definition
uses the ``name`` attribute in the manifest as its name and the value is
allocated by SPM.

The Partition ID can be set to a fixed value or omitted to be auto allocated.

.. code-block:: c

   #define name id-value

Please refer to ``<TF-M base folder>/tools/tfm_manifest_list.yaml`` for the PID
allocations.

About where to add the definition, please refer to the chapter `Add
configuration`_.

RoT Service ID (SID) Distribution
---------------------------------
An RoT Service is identified by its RoT Service ID (SID). A SID is a 32-bit
number that is associated with a symbolic name in the Secure Partition
manifest. The bits [31:12] uniquely identify the vendor of the RoT Service.
The remaining bits [11:0] can be used at the discretion of the vendor.

Here is the RoT Service ID table used in TF-M.

.. table:: SID table
   :widths: auto

   =========================== ====================== ========================
   **Services**                **Vendor ID(20 bits)** **Function ID(12 bits)**
   =========================== ====================== ========================

   =========================== ====================== ========================

RoT Service Stateless Handle Distribution
-----------------------------------------
A RoT Service may include stateless services. They are distinguished and
referenced by stateless handles. In manifest, a ``stateless_handle`` attribute
is set for indexing stateless services. The valid range is [1, 32] in current
implementation and may extend.

Here is the stateless handle allocation for partitions in TF-M. Partitions not
listed are not applied to stateless mechanism yet.

.. table:: Stateless Handle table
   :widths: auto

   =============================== =======================
    **Partition name**              **Stateless Handle**
   =============================== =======================
   TFM_SP_CRYPTO                   1
   TFM_SP_PS                       2
   TFM_SP_ITS                      3
   TFM_SP_INITIAL_ATTESTATION      4
   =============================== =======================

mmio_regions
------------
This attribute is a list of MMIO region objects which the Secure Partition
needs access to. TF-M only supports the ``named_region`` current. Please refer
to PSA FF for more details about it. The user needs to provide a name macro to
indicate the variable of the memory region.

TF-M uses the below structure to indicate a peripheral memory.

.. code-block:: c

  struct platform_data_t {
    uint32_t periph_start;
    uint32_t periph_limit;
    int16_t periph_ppc_bank;
    int16_t periph_ppc_loc;
  };

.. Note::
   This structure is not expected by TF-M, it's only that the current
   implementations are using. Other peripherals that need different information
   to create isolation need to define a different structure with the same name.

Here is a example for it:

.. code-block:: c

   struct platform_data_t tfm_peripheral_A;
   #define TFM_PERIPHERAL_A                 (&tfm_peripheral_A)

linker_pattern
--------------
``linker_pattern`` is a legacy region which contains the minimum information
required to link a Secure Partitionâ€™s compiled static objects. Now, it is
required as 'IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED' in PSA FF 1.0.0.

Library model support
---------------------
For the library model, the user needs to add a ``secure_functions`` item. The
main difference between ``secure_function`` and ``services`` is the extra
``signal`` key for secure function entry.

The ``signal`` must be the upper case of the secure function name.

.. code-block:: yaml

  "secure_functions": [
    {
      "name": "TFM_EXAMPLE_A",
      "signal": "EXAMPLE_A_FUNC",
      "sid": "0x00000000",
      "non_secure_clients": true,
      "version": 1,
      "version_policy": "STRICT"
    },

Add configuration
=================
The following configuration tasks are required for the newly added secure
partition:

Add CMake configure files
-------------------------
- CMakeLists.txt, which is the compilation configuration for this module.

The current CMake configuration should also be updated, by updating
config_default.cmake to include the definition of the newly introduced partition
and adding the relevant subdirectoy in ``secure_fw/CMakeLists.txt``.
Please refer to the source code of TF-M for more detail.

Update manifest list
--------------------
The ``<TF-M base folder>/tools/tfm_manifest_list.yaml`` is used to collect
necessary information of secure partition.

- ``name``: The name string of the secure partition.
- ``short_name``: should be the same as the ``name`` in the secure partition
  manifest file.
- ``manifest``: the relative path of the manifest file to TF-M root.
  In out-of-tree secure partition, ``manifest`` can be an absolute path or the
  relative path to the current manifest list file.
- ``conditional``: Optional. Configure control macro for this partition.
- ``version_major``: major version the partition manifest.
- ``version_minor``: minor version the partition manifest.
- ``pid``: Secure Partition ID value distributed in chapter `Secure Partition
  ID Distribution`_.
- ``output_dir``: Optional. Secure Partition can specify a relative path to
  ``<build_dir>/generated`` to hold the generated files.
  It enables Secure Partition to select a generated path independent from its
  source code path, for example in out-of-tree Secure Parition build.

Reference configuration example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    {
      "name": "Example Service",
      "short_name": "TFM_SP_EXAMPLE",
      "manifest": "secure_fw/partitions/EXAMPLE/tfm_example.yaml",
      "conditional": "TFM_PARTITION_EXAMPLE",
      "version_major": 0,
      "version_minor": 1,
      "pid": 256
    }

Implement the RoT services
==========================
To implement RoT services, the partition needs a source file which contains the
implementations of the services, as well as the partition entry point. The user
can create this source file under
``<TF-M base folder>/secure_fw/partitions/EXAMPLE/EXAMPLE.c``. The linker
detects source files according to the pattern matching defined by the
"linker_pattern" attribute in the ``tfm_manifest_list.yaml`` file.

As an example, the RoT service with SID **ROT_A** will be implemented.

Entry point function
--------------------
This function acts as a main() function for the partition.
On incoming signals for service calls, the entry point function handles
signals by calling the relevant service function.
An example entry point is given

.. code-block:: c

    void example_main(void)
    {
        psa_signal_t signals = 0;

        while (1) {
            signals = psa_wait(PSA_WAIT_ANY, PSA_BLOCK);
            if (signals & ROT_A_SIGNAL) {
                rot_A();
            } else {
                /* Should not come here */
                psa_panic();
            }
        }
    }

Service implementation
----------------------
The service is implemented by the ``rot_A()`` function, which is called upon an
incoming signal. This implementation is up to the user, however an example
service has been included for reference. The following example sends a message
"Hello World" when called.

.. code-block:: c

    static void rot_A(void)
    {
        const int BUFFER_LEN = 32;
        psa_msg_t msg;
        psa_status_t r;
        int i;
        uint8_t rec_buf[BUFFER_LEN];
        uint8_t send_buf[BUFFER_LEN] = "Hello World";

        psa_get(ROT_A_SIGNAL, &msg);
        switch (msg.type) {
        case PSA_IPC_CONNECT:
            if (service_in_use & ROT_A_SIGNAL) {
                r = PSA_ERROR_CONNECTION_REFUSED;
            } else {
                service_in_use |= ROT_A_SIGNAL;
                r = PSA_SUCCESS;
            }
            psa_reply(msg.handle, r);
            break;
        case PSA_IPC_CALL:
            for (i = 0; i < PSA_MAX_IOVEC; i++) {
                if (msg.in_size[i] != 0) {
                    psa_read(msg.handle, i, rec_buf, BUFFER_LEN);
                }
                if (msg.out_size[i] != 0) {
                    psa_write(msg.handle, i, send_buf, BUFFER_LEN);
                }
            }
            psa_reply(msg.handle, PSA_SUCCESS);
            break;
        case PSA_IPC_DISCONNECT:
            assert((service_in_use & ROT_A_SIGNAL) != 0);
            service_in_use &= ~ROT_A_SIGNAL;
            psa_reply(msg.handle, PSA_SUCCESS);
            break;
        default:
            /* cannot get here [broken SPM] */
            psa_panic();
            break;
        }
    }

Test connection
---------------
To test that the service has been implemented correctly, the user needs to call
it from somewhere. One option is to create a new testsuite, such as
``<TF-M-test base folder>/test/suites/example/non_secure/example_ns_interface_testsuite.c``.

.. code-block:: c

    static void tfm_example_test_1001(struct test_result_t *ret)
    {
        char str1[] = "str1";
        char str2[] = "str2";
        char str3[128], str4[128];
        struct psa_invec invecs[2] = {{str1, sizeof(str1)},
                                      {str2, sizeof(str2)}};
        struct psa_outvec outvecs[2] = {{str3, sizeof(str3)},
                                        {str4, sizeof(str4)}};
        psa_handle_t handle;
        psa_status_t status;
        uint32_t version;

        version = psa_version(ROT_A_SID);
        TEST_LOG("TFM service support version is %d.\r\n", version);
        handle = psa_connect(ROT_A_SID, ROT_A_VERSION);
        status = psa_call(handle, PSA_IPC_CALL, invecs, 2, outvecs, 2);
        if (status >= 0) {
            TEST_LOG("psa_call is successful!\r\n");
        } else {
            TEST_FAIL("psa_call is failed!\r\n");
            return;
        }

        TEST_LOG("outvec1 is: %s\r\n", outvecs[0].base);
        TEST_LOG("outvec2 is: %s\r\n", outvecs[1].base);
        psa_close(handle);
        ret->val = TEST_PASSED;
    }

Once the test and service has been implemented, the project can be built and
executed. The user should see the "Hello World" message in the console as
received by the testsuite.

Out-of-tree Secure Partition build
----------------------------------

TF-M supports out-of-tree Secure Partition build, whose source code folders
are maintained outside TF-M repo. Developers can configure
``TFM_EXTRA_MANIFEST_LIST_FILES`` and ``TFM_EXTRA_PARTITION_PATHS`` in build
command line to include out-of-tree Secure Partitions.

- ``TFM_EXTRA_MANIFEST_LIST_FILES``

  A list of the absolute path(s) of the manifest list(s) provided by out-of-tree
  Secure Partition(s).
  Use semicolons ``;`` to separate multiple manifest lists.

- ``TFM_EXTRA_PARTITION_PATHS``

  A list of the absoluate directories of the out-of-tree Secure Partition source
  code folder(s). TF-M build system searches ``CMakeLists.txt`` of partitions in
  the source code folder(s).
  Use semicolons ``;`` to separate multiple out-of-tree Secure Partition
  directorires.

A single out-of-tree Secure Partition folder can be orignazied as the figure
below.

::

  secure partition folder
        â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
        â”œâ”€â”€ manifest_list.yaml
        â”œâ”€â”€ out_of_tree_partition_manifest.yaml
        â””â”€â”€ source code

In the example above, ``TFM_EXTRA_MANIFEST_LIST_FILES`` and
``TFM_EXTRA_PARTITION_PATHS`` in the build command can be configured as listed
below.

.. code-block:: bash

  -DTFM_EXTRA_MANIFEST_LIST_FILES=<Absolute-path-sp-folder/manifest_list.yaml>
  -DTFM_EXTRA_PARTITION_PATHS=<Absolute-path-sp-folder>

Multiple out-of-tree Secure Partitions can be origanzied in diverse structures.
For example, multiple Secure Partitions can be maintained under the same
directory as shown below.

::

  top-level folder
        â”œâ”€â”€ Partition 1
        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ partition_1_manifest.yaml
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ source code
        â”œâ”€â”€ Partition 2
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
        â”œâ”€â”€ Partition 3
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
        â”œâ”€â”€ manifest_list.yaml
        â””â”€â”€ Root CMakeLists.txt

In the example above, a root CMakeLists.txt includes all the partitions'
CMakLists.txt, for example via ``add_subdirectory()``. The manifest_list.yaml
lists all partitions' manifest files.
``TFM_EXTRA_MANIFEST_LIST_FILES`` and ``TFM_EXTRA_PARTITION_PATHS`` in build
command line can be configured as listed below.

.. code-block:: bash

  -DTFM_EXTRA_MANIFEST_LIST_FILES=<Absolute-path-top-level-folder/manifes_list.yaml>
  -DTFM_EXTRA_PARTITION_PATHS=<Absolute-path-top-level-folder>

Alternatively, out-of-tree Secure Partitions can be separated in different
folders.

::

    partition 1 folder                    partition 2 folder
        â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt                    â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
        â”œâ”€â”€ manifest_list.yaml                â”œâ”€â”€ manifest_list.yaml
        â”œâ”€â”€ partition_1_manifest.yaml         â”œâ”€â”€ partition_2_manifest.yaml
        â””â”€â”€ source code                       â””â”€â”€ source code

In the example above, each Secure Partition manages its own manifest files and
CMakeLists.txt. ``TFM_EXTRA_MANIFEST_LIST_FILES`` and
``TFM_EXTRA_PARTITION_PATHS`` in build command line can be configured as listed
below.

.. code-block:: bash

  -DTFM_EXTRA_MANIFEST_LIST_FILES=<Absolute-path-part-1-folder/manifes_list.yaml>;<Absolute-path-part-2-folder/manifes_list.yaml>
  -DTFM_EXTRA_PARTITION_PATHS=<Absolute-path-part-1-folder>;<Absolute-path-part-2-folder>

.. Note::

   Manifest list paths in ``TFM_EXTRA_MANIFEST_LIST_FILES`` do NOT have to be
   one-to-one mapping to Secure Partition directories in
   ``TFM_EXTRA_PARTITION_PATHS``. The orders don't matter either.

Further Notes
-------------

- In the IPC model, Use PSA FF proposed memory accessing mechanism. SPM
  provides APIs and checking between isolation boundaries, a free accessing
  of memory can cause program panic.
- In the IPC model, the memory checking inside partition runtime is
  unnecessary. SPM handles the checking while memory accessing APIs are
  called.
- In the IPC model, the client ID had been included in the message structure
  and secure partition can get it when calling psa_get() function. The secure
  partition does not need to call ``tfm_core_get_caller_client_id()`` to get
  the caller client ID anymore.
- In the IPC model, SPM will check the security policy and partition
  dependence between client and service. So the service does not need to
  validate the secure caller anymore.
