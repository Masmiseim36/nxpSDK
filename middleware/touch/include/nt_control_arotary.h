/**
 * \defgroup arotary Analog Rotary Control
 * \ingroup controls
 *
 * Analog Rotary enables the detection of jog-dial-like finger movement using three or more electrodes;
 * it is represented by the nt_control structure.
 *
 * The Analog Rotary Control uses three or more specially-shaped electrodes to enable
 * the calculation of finger position within a circular area. The position algorithm uses the
 * ratio of sibling electrode signals to estimate the finger position with the required precision.
 *
 * The Analog Rotary works similarly to the "standard" Rotary, but requires less
 * electrodes, while achieving a higher resolution of the calculated position. For
 * example, a four-electrode Analog Rotary can provide the finger position detection in the
 * range of 0-64. The shape of the electrodes needs to be designed specifically to achieve
 * a stable signal with a linear dependence on finger movement.
 *
 * The Analog Rotary Control provides Position, Direction, and Displacement values. It
 * is able to generate event callbacks when finger Movement, Initial-touch, or Release is detected.
 *
 * The image below shows a typical four-electrode Analog Rotary electrode placement.
