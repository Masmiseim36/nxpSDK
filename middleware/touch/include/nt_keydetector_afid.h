 /**
 * \defgroup afid Advanced Filtering and Integrating Detection
 * \ingroup detectors
 * The AFID (Advanced Filtering and Integrating Detection) key detector is based on using two IIR filters
 * with different depths (one short / fast, the other long / slow) and on integrating the difference between the
 * two filtered signals. The algorithm uses two thresholds: the touch threshold and the release threshold. The touch
 * threshold is defined in the sensitivity register. The release threshold has a twice lower level than the touch threshold.
 * If the integrated signal is higher than the touch threshold, or lower than the release threshold, then the integrated signal is
 * reset. The touch state is reported for the electrode when the first touch reset is detected. The release state is reported
 * when as many release resets are detected as the touch resets were detected during the previous touch state.
