 /**
 * \defgroup usafa Usafa Detector
 * \ingroup detectors
 *
 * The usafa key detector is a method for recognizing the touch or release states. It can be used for each type of control.
 *
 * If the measured sample is reported as a valid sample, the module calculates the delta value from the actual signal and
 * baseline values. The delta value is compared to the threshold value computed from the expected signal and baseline values.
 * Based on the result, it determines the electrode state, which can be released, touched, changing from
 * released to touch, and changing from touched to release. This method is using moving average filters to determine the baseline and the expected signal values 
 * with a different depth of the filter, depending on the state of the electrode. The dead band filters in the horizontal and vertical directions are also implemented.

/**
 * The default Usafa settings of the key detector are:
 * - signal_filter (2 by default) 
 * - base_avrg (9 by default, which means 512 samples) 
 * - non_activity_avrg (NT_FILTER_MOVING_AVERAGE_MAX_ORDER by default, which means 65K samples) 
 * - entry_event_cnt (8 by default) 
 * - signal_to_noise_ratio (16 by default)
 * - deadband (10 by default)
 * - min_noise_limit (20 by default)
 * - dc_track_enabled (enabled by default), to avoid negative signal drop below baseline
 * - dc_track_cnt (100 by default), debouncing period
 * Here is an example definition of the default values for usafa ASC:
