 * \defgroup matrix_private Matrix Control
 * \ingroup controls_private
 *
 * The matrix implements a similar functionality to the keypad but the matrix has the electrode surfaces placed
 * closer to each other. Moreover, the matrix control allows processing the position tracking and gesture recognition. 
 * Usually, the matrix control is used for data processing from the touchpad hardware.  
 *
 * Applications may use the electrode API to determine the touch or release states of individual 
 * electrodes (digital approach) but the matrix control processes the electrodes as a two-dimensional array.
 * The images below show a simple electrode array where the self-cap sensing is used. 
 * \image html matrix.png "Matrix Self-cap Sensing Electrodes"
 * \image latex matrix.png "Matrix Self-cap Sensing Electrodes "
 * To recognize the position on the shown layout means to activate two electrodes (horizontal and
 * vertical). When this happens, the x and y coordinates of the touch position are known and can be tracked.
 * When the finger is moving on the surface, the actual x and y coordinates are changing 
 * in time and the position changes are stored into the buffer. At the end of the movement, the release 
 * position is stored as well and the gesture recognition algorithm can be executed.
 *
 * The same processing is used for the mutual-cap-sensing-based matrix where the position is known 
 * after touching one electrode only because the mutual-cap-sensing electrode consists of the Tx and Rx 
 * electrodes which determine the position on the surface by a mutual Tx and Rx electrode hardware interconnection.    
 * The position detection is only one difference between the self-cap and mutual-cap matrices. Other matrix control 
 * processing algorithms remain the same. The mutual-cap-sensing-based matrix is enabled by defining the value of "true" 
 * to the sensing_mode matrix constant, similarly like the matrix horizontal and vertical sizes.

 * 
 * The position recognition can be extended by a simple trick for both matrix types. The touch on the two nearest  
 * electrodes can be considered as virtual electrodes between the touched electrodes. In this way, the horizontal and 
 * vertical resolution can be extended by adding gaps between the electrodes. The new resolution is twice the original
 * resolution minus one (extended_resolution = origin_resolution + electrode_gaps = 2 * origin_resolution - 1).
 * If two nearest electrodes are activated at the same time, the algorithm determines that a virtual electrode
 * is activated between the real electrodes. 
 * 
 * The matrix control processes the position regardless of the finger size. A large finger activates 
 * more than one horizontal electrode and one vertical electrode for the self-cap mode. The algorithm ignores the other
 * nearest touched electrodes to centralize the recognized position. The feature ensures a most precise
 * position on the surface for next processing. The position can be determined from one, two, or three nearest 
 * electrodes. If more nearest electrodes are enabled, the position is recognized as two active figures. This rule is   
 * valid for horizontal and vertical electrodes. 
 * 
 * The matrix control algorithm recognizes the position of not only one finger but two fingers as well. 
 * The finger position or two finger positions are stored for the touch, release, and movement (actual position) events.
 * Also, the movement tracking and gestures can process two fingers.
 * 
 * The gesture feature is the most important part of the matrix control. The gestures can be divides to two groups: 
 * control gestures and unlock gestures. The control gestures are usually used to control the device, change the mode, 
 * configure a feature, or make some user action. The unlock gestures stored by the user are typically used to unlock the screen,
 * wake up the device, or recognize the movement more precisely. The matrix control enables to recognize 
 * these control gestures:
 *  - swipe up
 *  - swipe down
 *  - swipe left
 *  - swipe right
 *  - cover  
 *  - double tap
 *  - zoom in
 *  - zoom out
 *       
 * The conditions to recognize the swipe gestures:
 *  - buffered gesture must be longer than three recognized positions horizontally or vertically (for one finger)
 *  - recognized positions horizontally or vertically and the movement in dominant direction must cover twice the amount
 *    recognized positions than in insignificant direction  
 * 
 * The double tap gesture enables to define the maximum time interval between taps. To recognize the cover gesture, each touchpad 
 * electrode must be touched. The conditions to recognize the zoom in/out gestures: 
 *  - buffered gesture must be longer than three recognized positions horizontally or vertically (for both fingers)
 *  - square of the position distance change must be higher(lower) then 15(-15) to increment zoom in(out) counter
 *  - the number of zoom in(out) counters must be higher then 1 and the ration between zoom in and zoom out counters
 *    must be double at least  
 * 
 * You can store an arbitrary number of unlock gestures, limited by the free memory. The unlock gestures have higher 
 * priority than the control gestures. If both the unlock and control gestures are recognized, the control gesture is ignored.  
 * The unlock gesture means a continuous curve drawn by one finger or two continuous curves drawn by two fingers.  
 * The gesture can be stored from the drawn pattern into the RAM memory by changing the selected gesture variable (0 means no 
 * gesture to store; the number specifies which gesture number is stored). For permanent usage of the drawn gestures,
 * the stored gestures must be copied or rewritten as matrix gesture parameters to be stored into the flash memory. 
 * 
 * After the release event, the actual drawn gesture is buffered and compared to the stored unlock gestures (if any).  
 * The dissimilarity is a value that provides information about how much the actual gesture is similar to the stored ones.
 * In case of a calculated dissimilarity is lower the dissimilarity_max parameter defined in matrix constants, a specified 
 * gesture is recognized. A dissimilarity value of 0 means that the gestures are the same. 
 *
 * When drawing the gesture, the finger (or fingers) position changes are stored to a buffer. The maximum position resolution  
 * is 16 values (hexadecimal value) for each dimension. If the matrix is too small, the resolution can be extended by creating
 * virtual electrodes between the real ones. This feature is enabled by defining the value of "true" to the increase_resolution  
 * matrix constant. The conditions to recognize or store the unlock gestures:
 *  - buffered gesture must be longer than four recognized positions horizontally or vertically (for one or two fingers)
 *  - buffered gesture must be longer than four position changes to have enough recorded points for 
 * cooperation, 
 *  - buffered gesture must be shorter than sixteen position changes to not exceed the buffer size
 *  
 * The movement on the matrix surface is buffered in such way that each position change is stored into 64-bit x and y buffers
 * in the right to left order as a hexadecimal value. Therefore, the same gestures drawn by a different speed are not the
 * same because the buffer size is different. Considered this when a gesture is not recognized.
 * The gesture-comparison algorithm is based on the summation of the square point to point distances. 
 *  
 * The matrix control is represented by the nt_control_matrix structure.
