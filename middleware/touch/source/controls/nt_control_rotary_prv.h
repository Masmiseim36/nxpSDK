 *
 * Rotary enables the detection of jog-dial-like finger movement using discrete
 * electrodes; it is represented by the nt_control_rotary_control structure.
 *
 * The Rotary Control uses a set of discrete electrodes to enable the calculation of finger
 * position within a circular area. The position algorithm localizes the touched
 * electrode and its sibling electrodes to estimate the finger position. The Rotary consisting
 * of N electrodes enables the rotary position to be calculated in 2N steps.
 *
 * The Rotary Control provides Position, Direction, and Displacement values. It
 * is able to generate event callbacks when finger Movement, Initial-touch, or Release is detected.
 *
 * The image below shows a typical Rotary electrode placement.
