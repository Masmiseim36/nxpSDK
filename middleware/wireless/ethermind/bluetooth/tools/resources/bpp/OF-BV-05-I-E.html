<h2> Testing display
</h2>
<p><br /></p>
<div>There should not be a line break here, <p class = "inline">because, though this is a new
paragraph, its display has been set to "inline". </p> This text should display as one continuous
paragraph until here.</div>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>In this paragraph there is a span element and <span class = "block">all of this text 
with a border around it has its display property set to "block", so it should be on its own line
or lines</span>separate from the rest of the paragraph.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<ul>
	<li>This</li>
	<li>text</li>
	<li>should display as a</li>
	<li>sentence, not as </li>
	<li>a list</li>
</ul>
