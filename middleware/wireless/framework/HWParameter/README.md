# Production Data Storage

Hardware parameters provide production data storage

## Overview

Different platforms/boards need board/network node-specific settings to function according to the design. (Examples of such settings are IEEEÂ® addresses and radio calibration values specific to the node.) For this purpose, the last flash sector is reserved and contains hardware-specific parameters for production data storage. These parameters pertain to the network node as a distinct entity. For example, a silicon mounted on a PCB in a specific configuration, rather than to just the silicon itself. This sector is reserved by the linker file, through the PROD_DATA section and it should be read/written only thorough the API described below.

> Note :
This sector is not erased/written at code download time and it is not updated via over-the-air firmware update procedures to preserve the respective node-specific data, regardless of the firmware running on it.

## Constant Definitions

Name :

```
extern uint32_t PROD_DATA_BASE_ADDR[];
```

Description :

This symbol is defined in the linker script. It specifies the start address of the PROD_DATA section.

Name :

```
static const uint8_t mProdDataIdentifier[10] = {"PROD_DATA:"};
```

Description :

The value of this constant is copied as identification word (header) at the beginning of the PROD_DATA area and verified by the dedicated read function.

## Data type definitions
Name : 


```
typedef PACKED_STRUCT hardwareParameters_tag{    
	uint8_t identificationWord[10];    
	uint8_t ieee_802_15_4_address[8];    
	uint8_t bluetooth_address[6];    
	uint32_t xtalTrim;    
	uint8_t reserved[64];    
	uint16_t hardwareParamsCrc;    
}hardwareParameters_t;
```

Description:

Defines the structure of the hardware-dependent information.


> Note :
Some members of this structure may be ignored on a specific board/silicon configuration. Also, new members may be added for implementation-specific purposes and the backward compatibility must be maintained.

The CRC calculation starts from the reserved field of the hardwareParameters_t and ends before the hardwareParamsCrc field. Additional members to this structure may be added using the following method :

Add new fields before the reserved field. This method does not cause a CRC fail, but you must keep in mind to subtract the total size of the new fields from the size of the reserved field. For example, if a field of uint8_t size is added using this method, the size of the reserved field shall be changed to 63.
