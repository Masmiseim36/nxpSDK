    - New features:
      - Added support for DCP driver.

  - 3.9.8_rev2
    - New features:
      - Added support for CAU3 driver.

  - 3.9.8_rev1
    - New features:
      - Added support for CAAM driver.
      - Added FREESCALE_ALT macros.

  - 3.9.8
    - New features:
      - Added support for AES and SHA acceleration modules of LPC devices.
        Accelerates AES and SHA wolfSSL modules.
      - LTC acceleration for AES CBC now updates IV.

    - Bug fixes:
      - Fixed K8x/KL8x LTC RSA sign when FREESCALE_LTC_TFM_RSA_4096_ENABLE macro is enabled.

  - 3.9.0
    - New features:
      - Added more LTC public key acceleration (curve25519, ed25519 and RSA4096).
      - FREESCALE_LTC_TFM_RSA_4096_ENABLE macro added to enable RSA4096 on K8x/KL8x LTC.
      - LTC_MAX_ECC_BITS increased to 384 to enable ECC-384 curve acceleration on LTC.
      - FREESCALE_LTC_SHA added for KL8x SHA-1 and SHA-256 hardware acceleration.

    - Other changes:
      - wolfSSL/wolfcrypt/settings.h is changed to remove unused macros and add support for KSDK 2.0.
      - LTC public key acceleration is implemented in separate source file ksdk_port.h and ksdk_port.c

  - 3.8.0
    - New features:
      - Added support for LTC hardware acceleration module.
        Accelerates AES, 3DES, TFM module (modular integer arithmetic) and ECC wolfSSL modules.
      - Added support for random number generator modules TRNG and RNGA.

    - Other changes:
      - The MMCAU acceleration now uses "fsl_mmcau.h" instead of "cau_api.h".
      - In DSA, wc_dsaSign() changed to repeate wc_RNG_GenerateBlock() until k is less than q.
      - wolfSSL/wolfcrypt/settings.h is changed to remove unused macros and add support for KSDK 2.0.
      - In wolfcrypt/src/asn.c, ksdk_time(time_t) changed to extern, to be defined by application.
