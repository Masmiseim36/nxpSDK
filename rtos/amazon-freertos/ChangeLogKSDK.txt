      - Tickless idle mode support for Cortex-A7. Add fsl_tickless_epit.c and fsl_tickless_generic.h in portable/IAR/ARM_CA9 folder.
      - Enabled float context saving in IAR for Cortex-A7. Added configUSE_TASK_FPU_SUPPORT macros. Modified port.c and portmacro.h in portable/IAR/ARM_CA9 folder.
    - Other changes:
      - Transformed ARM_CM core specific tickless low power support into generic form under freertos/Source/portable/low_power_tickless/.

  - 9.0.0_rev2

  - 9.0.0_rev1
    - New features:
      - Enabled -flto optimization in GCC by adding __attribute__((used)) for vTaskSwitchContext.
      - Enabled KDS Task Aware Debugger. Apply FreeRTOS patch to enable configRECORD_STACK_HIGH_ADDRESS macro. Modified files are task.c and FreeRTOS.h.
