This file describes the directories found at the root of the Amazon FreeRTOS
distribution.

lib:
Contains the implementation of AWS and third party libraries.  AWS libraries use
abstracted interfaces to enable interchangeability and facilitate porting to new
hardware.

Contains a set of pre-configured demo projects for various target platforms.
The projects in the demos directory build the libraries from the lib directory.

tests:
Various module and integration tests that use the Unity framework. These tests 
also support the Amazon FreeRTOS Qualification Program (AFQP).
