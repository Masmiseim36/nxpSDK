Version 1.6.0 -- 2021-03-10
---------------------------

This release fixes a bug where litani would crash when given the
`--timeout` option.


Version 1.5.0 -- 2021-03-08
---------------------------

- The implementation of directory locking no longer releases the lock
  upon creation. This fixes a problem where external processes could
  release a lock that a different process had acquired.


Version 1.4.0 -- 2021-03-02
---------------------------

- lib.litani now exposes a LockableDirectory API that can be used to
  lock directories against concurrent access by more than one process.
  External processes can use this API to lock report directories while
  reading or copying them.

- Litani now touches a file called `.litani-expired` in HTML report
  directories as soon as a new report directory has been written, and
  after the `html` symbolic link has been updated to point to the new
  directory. Litani then deletes all report directories that are both
  expired and unlocked.


Version 1.3.0 -- 2021-02-24
---------------------------

- Litani now has a top-level command called `print-capabilities` that
  prints out a list of features in either human or machine-readable format.
  The intention is that any new API-changing features will be accompanied by a
  new entry in this list


Version 1.2.0 -- 2021-02-24
---------------------------

- Litani now renders the HTML directory atomically. The `html` directory is now
  a symbolic link that is updated only after the report has been completely
  written.
- Added dark mode for all report pages


Version 1.1.0 -- 2021-02-03
---------------------------

- Added a new top-level command, `litani graph`. This dumps a
  Graphviz-formatted graph to stdout that describes the dependency graph
  of the jobs that have been added so far.
